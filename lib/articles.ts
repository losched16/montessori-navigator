    content: `Understanding the Path to Mastery

 

Few things puzzle Montessori parents more than repetition. You watch your child pour water for the tenth time, polish the same object day after day, or choose the same work every morning for weeks on end. A quiet worry creeps in: Are they bored? Shouldn’t they be moving on? Are they learning enough?

This mix of wonder and anxiety is entirely natural. From an adult perspective, repetition often signals monotony or lack of challenge. In Montessori, it signals something very different. Repetition is not stagnation. It is evidence that deep, important developmental work is underway.

To understand why, we need to look beneath the surface (past the visible activity) and into how young children actually learn.

What Adults See vs. What Children Are Doing

When adults repeat a task, we usually do so to become faster or more efficient. Once efficiency is achieved, we move on. Children, however, repeat for a different reason entirely. They repeat to construct understanding.

A three- or four-year-old pouring water is not simply practicing pouring. They are refining coordination, calibrating muscle

control, judging distance, managing impulse, and aligning intention with action. Each repetition integrates body and mind a little more tightly.

What looks the same to us is never the same to the child.

Repetition Is How the Brain Wires Itself

Early Childhood is a period of intense brain development. Neural connections are formed and strengthened through repeated experience. When children repeat an activity they have freely chosen, they are literally building and stabilizing neural pathways.

“Repetition is not stagnation. It

is evidence that deep, important developmental work is underway.”

This is why Montessori places such emphasis on uninterrupted work cycles. When children are allowed to repeat without interruption, distraction, or pressure to move on, concentration deepens. And when concentration deepens, learning becomes embodied rather than superficial.

Dr. Maria Montessori described this process as the child “normalizing”—not becoming compliant or quiet, but becoming centered, focused, and deeply engaged. Repetition is the doorway to this state.

Mastery Is Not About Speed or Novelty

In conventional thinking, mastery is often equated with speed: finishing quickly, checking the box, moving ahead. Montessori defines mastery differently. Mastery means the child has integrated a skill so fully that it becomes part of who they are.

This kind of mastery cannot be rushed. It requires time, repetition, and the freedom to practice until the inner need is satisfied. Children instinctively know when they are done. Adults often intervene too soon.

When a child repeats an activity day after day, it is because something inside them is still unfolding. When the work is complete, they move on—often suddenly and without prompting.

Repetition Builds Confidence and Inner Security

There is an emotional dimension to repetition that is easy to overlook. Repetition gives children a sense of control and predictability in a world that often feels large and overwhelming.

Each successful repetition reinforces a powerful internal message: I can do this. That confidence does not come from praise or external rewards. It comes from lived experience.

This is why Montessori classrooms are calm and purposeful. Children who are allowed to repeat freely are not anxious or restless. They are grounded. They know where they belong in the environment, and they trust their own abilities.

When Adults Interrupt the Process

Well-meaning adults sometimes interrupt repetition unintentionally. We suggest something “more challenging,” worry about wasted time, or redirect toward variety. While enrichment has its place, premature interruption can undermine the very process that leads to genuine growth.

3–6 Years | The Elementary Years

Children who are allowed to repeat freely are learning how to stay with a task, how to tolerate difficulty, and how to complete something thoroughly.

When children are pulled away from repetition too soon, they may comply, but the inner work remains unfinished. Over time, this can lead to shallow engagement, reduced concentration, and a constant search for external stimulation.

Maria Montessori’s quiet wisdom is to trust the child’s inner timetable.

Repetition and the Development of Will

One of Montessori’s most profound insights was that repetition strengthens the will. Each time a child chooses the same work again, they are exercising intention, persistence, and self-discipline.

This is not forced repetition. It is self-chosen. And that distinction matters.

Children who are allowed to repeat freely are learning how to stay with a task, how to tolerate difficulty, and how to complete something thoroughly. These capacities form the foundation for later academic learning, emotional regulation, and resilience.

How Parents Can Support This at Home

For parents, the takeaway is both simple and challenging: Allow space for repetition without rushing it or apologizing for it.

At home, this might mean:

• Letting your child help with the same household task repeatedly;

• Resisting the urge to rotate toys constantly;

• Valuing focus over novelty, and

• Allowing activities to unfold slowly.

When you notice yourself thinking, They already know this, pause and reframe the question: What might they still be

building?

Reassurance for Anxious Moments

It is understandable to worry whether your child is “doing enough.” Montessori reassures us that depth matters more than speed, and integration matters more than exposure.

Repetition is a sign of health. It tells us that the child feels safe, interested, and internally motivated. These are precisely the conditions under which meaningful learning occurs.

And when questions or concerns arise, your child’s Montessori guide is an invaluable partner. They observe patterns across days and weeks, understand developmental trajectories, and can help you see when repetition is serving growth—and when the child is ready for something new.

What looks like “again and again” from the outside is, for the child, a quiet journey toward mastery. Montessori invites us to trust that journey—and to marvel at how much is happening beneath the surface. `,

The Emotional Life of Infants and How Montessori Supports Regulation from the Very Beginning

 

When parents think about emotional development, they often picture conversations with older children (naming feelings, talking through conflicts, learning coping strategies). It’s easy to assume that emotional regulation begins once children have words.

Montessori invites us to see something very different.

Long before children can speak, they’re already living rich emotional lives. Infants experience joy, frustration, fear, curiosity, and calm with remarkable intensity. The question isn’t whether emotions exist in the first years of life; the question is how children learn to live with them. Montessori environments are intentionally designed to support emotional regulation well before language develops—quietly, respectfully, and with profound long-term impact.

This early emotional groundwork shapes not only how children behave but how they experience themselves and the world for years to come.

Emotional Regulation Begins with Co-Regulation

In the first three years, children aren’t capable of regulating emotions independently. Neurologically, the systems responsible for self-regulation are still under construction. What infants and toddlers need is co-regulation (the steady presence of a calm, responsive adult who helps them return to balance).

Montessori environments take this reality seriously. Rather than expecting infants to “self-soothe” prematurely or suppress emotional expression, Montessori guides respond to

distress with presence, consistency, and respect. Crying isn’t treated as misbehavior; it’s communication.

A baby who is picked up when upset, spoken to gently, and cared for predictably isn’t being spoiled. That baby is learning a fundamental emotional lesson: When I’m overwhelmed, the world helps me.

Over time, that external support becomes internalized. Emotional regulation is built from the outside in.

The Prepared Environment as Emotional Support

One of Montessori’s most powerful—and often misunderstood—contributions to emotional development is the “prepared environment.” While it’s typically discussed in terms of independence and concentration, its emotional impact is equally significant.

Montessori infant and toddler environments are designed to reduce unnecessary stressors: calm, uncluttered spaces; predictable routines; soft lighting and neutral colors; limited noise and overstimulation; and consistent caregivers.

For an infant, chaos isn’t stimulating; it’s dysregulating. When the environment is orderly and predictable, the child’s nervous system can relax. Emotional regulation is supported through atmosphere not instruction.

This is why Montessori classrooms often feel quieter and more grounded than conventional childcare settings. The calm is intentional, and it’s deeply protective of the child’s emotional well-being.

Respectful Caregiving and Emotional Safety

Daily caregiving routines (feeding, diapering, dressing, transitions) are the emotional backbone of the Montessori Infant and Toddler classroom experience. These moments aren’t rushed tasks to be completed efficiently. They’re opportunities for connection.

Montessori guides slow down, speak to children before touching them, describe what’s happening, and invite participation when possible. Even infants, who can’t yet respond verbally, are treated as partners in their own care. This respect communicates something essential: You matter. Your body belongs to you. You are safe with me.

Emotional regulation grows most reliably in relationships where children feel seen rather than managed.

Emotional regulation grows most reliably in relationships where children feel seen rather than managed.

Observation: Listening without Words

One of the most distinctive Montessori practices is observation. Guides are trained to watch carefully before intervening, learning to read cues that infants and toddlers express through movement, facial expression, and behavior.

A toddler who throws materials may be overwhelmed, not defiant. An infant who arches away may be overstimulated, not resistant. Montessori environments are structured to allow adults the time and space to notice these signals.

By responding appropriately (sometimes by stepping in, sometimes by stepping back), the adult helps the child return to equilibrium. Over time, children learn that their internal states are understandable and manageable.

This is the beginning of emotional intelligence.

Freedom within Limits: Emotional Containment

Montessori is often described as offering “freedom within limits.” In the first three years, this balance plays a crucial emotional role.

Children are given freedom to move, explore, and express themselves, but always within clear, consistent boundaries. Limits are calm and predictable, not reactive or punitive.

When a limit is set, it’s enforced gently and firmly. This consistency provides emotional containment. Children don’t need endless choice or unrestricted freedom; they need to know where the edges are. Clear limits help young children feel secure, reduce anxiety and emotional volatility.

Paradoxically, it’s this structure that allows genuine emotional freedom to develop.

Big Feelings, Calm Adults

Montessori doesn’t aim to eliminate tantrums, tears, or frustration. These are natural parts of early development; instead, Montessori environments normalize big feelings while modeling calm responses.

When adults remain regulated in the presence of dysregulation, children learn an invaluable lesson: emotions are survivable. They rise, they peak, and they pass.

There’s no shaming, no escalation, no need to “fix” the feeling. The adult’s calm becomes the child’s borrowed calm— until, gradually, it becomes their own.

This process unfolds slowly, but its effects are lasting.

Why Early Emotional Work Matters So Much

Maria Montessori believed that peace begins in early childhood, not as an abstract ideal, but as a lived emotional experience. Modern research increasingly supports her insight.

Children who experience emotional attunement early in life are more likely to develop secure relationships, manage stress effectively, show empathy and self-awareness, and navigate social challenges with resilience.

These capacities don’t appear suddenly in the elementary years. They’re built quietly, day by day, in infancy and toddlerhood.

For parents, Montessori’s approach to emotional development can be both reassuring and challenging. It asks adults to slow down, to observe, and to respond thoughtfully rather than reactively. It asks us to trust development rather than rush it.

Supporting emotional regulation in the first three years doesn’t require elaborate strategies. It requires presence, predictability, respect, and patience.

Long before children can name their feelings, they’re learning how it feels to have them. Montessori ensures that what they learn is safety, dignity, and trust—foundations that support emotional strength for a lifetime.​ 

    content: `Beyond Diapers

Few topics generate more anxiety for parents of toddlers than toileting. Is my child ready? Am I pushing too soon? Should we wait? Modern disposable diapers have made postponing the process easier than ever before. Montessori offers a different perspective—one grounded in developmental readiness and deep respect for the child.

This approach isn’t about rushing children or enforcing timelines. It’s about recognizing when a child’s neurological development supports toilet learning and understanding why continuing diapers past that point may unintentionally delay independence and body awareness.

Readiness Is Neurological, Not Chronological

Montessori toilet learning begins with observation, not age. When the brain and nervous system reach sufficient maturity, children naturally begin to notice bodily signals, anticipate elimination, and coordinate the physical steps of toileting.

Why Montessori Encourages Toilet Learning When Children Are Neurologically Ready

Signs of neurological readiness include:

Awareness of being wet or soiled, often expressed

through discomfort or communication;

Predictable elimination patterns (waking dry from

naps, regular timing);

Ability to follow two- or three-step sequences (“Let’s

go to the bathroom, pull down pants, sit”);

Increasing motor control and coordination; and

Interest in bathroom routines or desire to participate

in self-care

When these capacities emerge (typically between 18 and 30 months of age), the child’s nervous system is signaling readiness. Continuing exclusive use of diapers at this stage can create confusion. Although the body signals capability, the environment says it’s unnecessary.

Learning to use the toilet isn’t about pleasing adults. It’s about the child discovering: My body belongs to me, and I can care for it.

Montessori asks us to align support with development rather than convenience.

How Diapers Affect Body Awareness

Modern disposable diapers excel at keeping children comfortable regardless of elimination. While this serves infants well, it can inadvertently delay awareness once neurological readiness emerges.

Body awareness develops through simple but important feedback loops: I feel pressure. I release. I notice wetness. I connect these sensations. When diapers absorb everything instantly, this learning loop becomes weaker. Children receive less sensory information about what their body is doing, which can delay their ability to recognize and respond to these internal cues.

This doesn’t mean diapers harm infants or young toddlers. They serve an important purpose early on; however, once a child can recognize and respond to bodily signals, continued reliance on diapers may decrease the very awareness needed for independent toileting.

Toilet Learning as Self-Care, Not Compliance

Montessori frames toileting not as a behavioral milestone but as natural self-care, parallel to feeding oneself or washing hands. Dr. Montessori observed that children possess a deep drive toward independence. When adults support this drive, children experience competence and dignity. When it’s inadvertently blocked, children may resist or disengage.

Learning to use the toilet isn’t about pleasing adults. It’s about the child discovering: My body belongs to me, and I can care for it.

Montessori toilet learning is designed to support the child’s growing independence, always with thoughtful adult su pervision. Children are given the tools they need to succeed—rather than having tasks done for them—so they can take ownership of the process. This includes wearing loose, easily manageable clothing and having consistent access to a child-sized toilet throughout the learning period. When the environment is prepared and the adult observes and supports without interfering, the child is empowered to develop confidence, coordination, and self-awareness at their own pace.

Why Delayed Support Sometimes Creates Resistance

Many parents assume waiting longer makes toileting easier. Sometimes the opposite occurs. Children who are neurologically ready but kept in diapers may assert control through refusal, anxiety around toileting, or resistance to transitions.

This isn’t defiance. It’s often the child communicating: I’m capable, but I’m not being allowed to try.

Montessori environments introduce toileting gently at the developmental window when curiosity and capability align, before frustration builds. When offered respectfully at the right moment, toilet learning rarely becomes a power struggle.

The Environment Enables Independence

Success relies on intentional preparation. When children are expected to use adult-sized bathrooms designed for adult bodies, they face unnecessary challenges that hinder independence and confidence.

A supportive environment includes:

• Child-sized toilet or secure toilet insert with stable footing

• Sturdy step stool for independent climbing

0–3 Years | The Early Years

• Simple clothing (elastic waistbands, avoid overalls or complex fasteners)

• Accessible sink or basin for handwashing

• Calm, predictable routines without urgency

When the environment supports capability, toileting becomes something the child does rather than something done to them.

Montessori toileting never involves coercion, shame, or punishment. Accidents are treated as information, not failure. Adults model calm confidence, such as offering reminders without anxiety, assistance without intrusion, and encouragement without rewards or charts.

The message remains consistent: Your body is learning. I trust you.

Throughout this process, it’s important to avoid praise/ shame language (such as Good job!, or Uh-oh!). Instead, use observation-based language. Here are a few examples:

• Your pants are dry.

• Your pants are wet. Let’s change into dry ones.

• You worked hard to get to the toilet.

• You are learning to care for yourself.

This preserves emotional well-being while supporting physical development.

Nighttime and Temporary Setbacks

Daytime readiness differs from nighttime dryness, which depends on physiological maturation (often coming months or years later) and is largely involuntary. Montessori doesn’t equate nighttime accidents with lack of readiness.

Temporary regressions during illness, travel, or major transitions are normal. The response is to return to support, not to abandon progress.

The Deeper Lesson: Dignity and Self-Trust

At its heart, Montessori’s approach to toileting is about dignity. Children who learn to listen to their bodies, respond appropriately, and care for themselves develop quiet confidence that extends far beyond the bathroom.

They internalize:

• Awareness of internal signals

• Responsibility without shame

• Trust in their capabilities

• Respect for their bodies

For Parents Navigating this Stage

If you’re wondering whether to begin, observe your child. Are they showing signs of awareness? Can they communicate needs? Do they show interest in the bathroom?

You’re not rushing your child by offering support when they’re neurologically ready; you’re honoring development. Your child’s Montessori guide can be an invaluable partner in this process, observing readiness patterns throughout the school day and helping align home and school

approaches.

Moving beyond diapers isn’t about growing up too fast. It’s about allowing children to grow when they’re ready— with confidence, dignity, and trust in their unfolding capabilities. 

On January 6, 1907, Dr. Maria Montessori opened the first Casa dei Bambini—the Children’s House—in a poor tenement district of Rome. The children who entered that classroom were widely viewed as difficult, neglected, and incapable of learning. What Montessori observed there changed not only her career but the course of education itself.

When these children were given order, beauty, meaningful work, and freedom within clear limits, something remarkable happened. They became calmer, more focused, more independent, and more socially connected. Not because anyone trained them to behave differently, but because the obstacles blocking their natural development were removed.

That first classroom matters today not as a historical milestone, but because its purpose remains unchanged: creating the conditions that allow children to become fully themselves.

What Montessori Meant by

“Normalization”

Few Montessori terms are as important—or as misunderstood—as normalization.

Normalization does not mean conformity or compliance. It does not mean suppressing personality or producing unusually obedient children. Montessori used the term to describe something closer to psychological health: a child who can concentrate deeply, act independently, regulate their own behavior, and engage constructively with others.

Montessori observed that many behaviors adults assume are simply “how children are”—restlessness, short attention spans, defiance, withdrawal, or constant dependence—often emerge when children’s developmental needs are not being met. These behaviors are adaptations, not character traits.

When children experience constant interruption, a lack of meaningful work, chaotic or overly controlled environments, or excessive help paired with minimal responsibility, they adjust in ways that may appear to be temperament but are in fact signals of unmet needs.

When conditions are right, a different picture emerges. The normalized child shows sustained concentration, growing confidence, internal self-discipline, a love of order and purposeful activity, and genuine concern for others. Montessori observed this pattern repeatedly, across cultures and circumstances.

Why This Matters More than Ever

Montessori made these discoveries over a century ago, yet they feel strikingly relevant today. Many of the pressures that disrupt healthy development have intensified.

Modern childhood often includes constant stimulation, frequent interruptions, adult-paced schedules, limited opportunities for deep focus, and heavy screen exposure. Children are often given many choices but little meaningful responsibility, and adults—out of love—may step in too quickly, unintentionally undermining developing independence.

Even in caring homes, children can be pulled away from their natural developmental rhythm. When they cannot concentrate deeply, act independently, or contribute meaningfully, their behavior often reflects that imbalance. What we see as difficult behavior is often a message, not a flaw.

The Environment Is Key

Montessori’s approach began with observation, not theory. If children’s struggles were rooted in their environment, then changing the environment could support their return to balance.

The prepared environment supports normalization through a few essential elements.

Order and predictability help children orient themselves without constant adult direction. Meaningful work—real activities with purpose—focuses attention in a way entertainment never can. Freedom within clear, consistent limits allows self-regulation to develop. Beauty and simplicity calm rather than overstimulate. Respectful adults support independence rather than fostering dependence.

When children are given uninterrupted time to engage in purposeful work, concentration appears. With concentration comes calmer behavior, patience, self-control, and kindness. Montessori’s great insight was that discipline and social harmony need not be imposed; they emerge naturally when children are properly supported.

What This Means for Parents

January 6 reminds us that Montessori was never primarily about academic acceleration or achievement. From the beginning, it was about helping children reconnect with their natural developmental path.

That matters deeply today, as many families grapple with attention challenges, anxiety, impulsivity, and

social disconnection. Montessori’s promise re mains simple and profound: when we protect

what children genuinely need—order, meaningful work, freedom with limits, respect, and uninterrupted time—children tend to find their way back to themselves.

Normalization is not about perfection. Children will still have hard days, strong emotions, and moments of struggle. But this lens helps parents respond with clarity and compassion, understanding behavior as information rather than identity.

Living This Legacy at Home

Honoring Montessori’s legacy does not require dramatic changes. Often, it means small, intentional shifts.

Protect time for your child to work without rushing. Reduce interruptions when they are deeply engaged. Allow greater independence before intervening to help. Invite children into real household work, not as chores

0-6 Years | Early Childhood

to endure but as meaningful contributions. When behavior becomes difficult, look first at sleep, transitions, stimulation, and opportunities for responsibility before assuming a character problem.

These simple choices align home life more closely with children’s developmental needs.

Your Child’s Guide As Partner

If you are unsure what your child needs at present, your Montessori guide is an invaluable resource. Guides observe children over time within a carefully prepared

community and can interpret behavior through a developmental lens, distinguishing between typical challenges and signs of unmet needs.

Their goal is the same as Montessori’s in that first Children’s House: to help each child remain connected to their natural capacities for concentration, confidence, and joyful engagement.

This is Montessori’s enduring gift—not a method alone, but a vision of childhood rooted in trust, respect, and the belief that children flourish when we create the conditions they truly need. `,

    content: `Why Montessori Adolescents Question Authority

12–18 Years The Adolescent Years

 

Your 13-year-old looks at you and says, “That rule doesn’t make sense.” They point out an inconsistency in something you just said. Or they challenge a school policy as unfair.

If you’re raising a Montessori adolescent, this probably feels familiar, annoying, and exhausting. The child who once accepted rules without much pushback now interrogates decisions, questions authority, and presses for explanations. It may even feel personal. And it’s natural to wonder: Is this healthy? Or have we raised someone who can’t accept authority at all?

Montessori’s answer is clear: This questioning isn’t a problem. It’s a sign of healthy development.

What’s Changing in Adolescence

Dr. Montessori described adolescence as a second major transformation, comparable to Early Childhood. Adolescents are reorganizing themselves cognitively, emotionally, and socially. One of the most significant shifts can be recognized when children are no longer satisfied with what is. They urgently need to understand why things are the way they are—and whether they should be.

Authority based solely on position (“because I’m the parent”), habit (“that’s how we’ve always done it”), or convenience (“because I said so”) no longer feels legitimate. These children are not trying to be difficult. They’re building their own internal framework for judgment, deciding what is fair, reasonable, and deserving of respect.

This is not rebellion for its own sake. It’s the emergence of moral and intellectual independence.

Important Developmental Work

When adolescents challenge rules or decisions, they’re doing important developmental work:

• Distinguishing power from legitimacy by recognizing that authority must be justified, not merely asserted.

• Testing consistency and fairness by asking whether rules align with stated values.

• Understanding systems rather than simply complying with them.

• Taking responsibility for their own thinking instead of borrowing it from adults.

A child who never questions authority hasn’t developed independence. They’ve learned compliance. Montessori’s goal has never been obedience; it’s discernment.

How Montessori Supports This Development

Montessori Adolescent programs deliberately place students in situations that require them to analyze systems: economic, social, political, environmental, and ethical.

Adolescents may run small businesses, study social movements, participate in community governance, or grapple with real-world environmental challenges. These experiences help them understand why rules exist, how systems function, and when change is justified.

This doesn’t mean “anything goes.” Clear boundaries, accountability, and expectations remain essential. What changes is how authority is exercised. Instead of “follow this rule because I’m the adult,” the message becomes: “Here’s why this expectation exists. What do you think would happen without it?”

The goal isn’t blind obedience; instead it’s internalized standards.

Questioning vs. Disrespect

Parents often struggle to distinguish between healthy questioning and disrespect.

Healthy questioning sounds like curiosity, thoughtful disagreement, or frustration paired with engagement.

Disrespect shows up as contempt, personal attacks, refusal to listen, or deliberate rule-breaking after discussion.

The distinction matters. Questioning should be met with explanation and dialogue. Disrespect should be addressed calmly and clearly, with boundaries and consequences.

Many families find it helpful to say explicitly: “I want you to question things that don’t make sense. That’s important. But questioning must be done respectfully.”

This is not rebellion for its own sake. It's the emergence of moral and intellectual independence.

Why This Feels Especially Intense with

Montessori Adolescents

Montessori adolescents often question more persistently and articulately than their peers because they’ve been practicing these skills for years. They’re accustomed to being taken seriously, to reasoning rather than complying, and to expressing their thinking clearly.

That means parents often get the unpolished version of these emerging capacities. It can be impressive—and maddening—simultaneously.

How to Respond

When your adolescent challenges a rule, try to:

• Pause before reacting.

• Acknowledge the question as legitimate.

• Explain your reasoning, not just the rule.

• Invite their thinking without yielding responsibility.

• Be clear about what’s negotiable, what’s not, and why.

• Follow through consistently.

Not every challenge requires a full debate. Sometimes it’s enough to say, “I hear your disagreement. We can talk more later. For now, this is the expectation.”

Preparing for a Complex World

Adolescents allowed to question thoughtfully—while held to standards of respect—tend to emerge with strong internal values, the ability to disagree without destroying relationships, and respect for authority that’s earned rather than imposed. These capacities are essential for adult life. They don’t appear suddenly at 18. They develop through practice in adolescence—messy, inconvenient practice.

Supporting this stage asks parents to shift from control to mentorship, from issuing directives to explaining reasoning. It doesn’t mean abandoning boundaries. It means recognizing that the tools that worked at age seven no longer serve at thirteen.

And on the days when it feels like too much, it’s okay to pause, set limits, and say, “That’s a good question. Let’s come back to it.”

Your adolescent’s questioning isn’t a failure of Montessori education. It’s evidence that it’s working. You’re raising someone who will think critically, challenge unjust systems, and act from internal conviction rather than fear of punishment.

That is demanding work—for them and for you. But it’s work worth doing. 

    content: `12–18 Years The Adolescent Years

 

For all typically developing children, the transition from childhood to adolescence and eventually to adulthood, with all its expectations and responsibilities, requires a lot of learning. Now, perhaps more than at any other time in human history, the level of expectation, both in productivity and speed of transition into adulthood, is higher. In recognizing the potential of all children, we often assume that teenagers and young adults should behave, respond, and act in a certain way because they are physically able to and have likely demonstrated the cognitive ability to do so.

Many young adults look and seem like full-grown adults, and we can’t help but have preconceived notions that they

should behave like adults. What neuroscience has discovered is that the brain does not develop at the same rate as the rest of the body and that it does not develop uniformly. For example, the limbic system (responsible for emotions) develops before the prefrontal cortex (responsible for logic and decision-making).

In working with teens, the world often places unfair and unrealistic expectations on them because people can’t help but see them as adults. So, when it comes to driving cars or making risky decisions, etc., adolescents are often expected to think, behave, respond, and make decisions that they don’t yet have the experience to make responsibly.

In Secondary Montessori education, we both recognize this and develop curricula to address adolescents’ developmental needs, then provide opportunities for them to fulfill them. This raises the question, what does that even mean? What do they need?

Society and the Department of Education (or international equivalent) support the notion that all students need a certain level of general knowledge about history, science, and culture. There is also agreement that literacy is necessary, as it is the gateway for the acquisition of other skills. The long-held belief in the universal necessity of traditional, isolated academic subjects, such as algebra II and chemistry, is being challenged by rapid technological advances, such as AI, advanced word processing, and calculators in everyone’s palms, with some considering these subjects to be increasingly obsolete.

What is the Work of Adolescents?

Dr. Montessori viewed adolescence as a period of profound inner change, not only physical but also psychological. Adolescents are grappling with urgent questions, such as:

Who am I becoming? What matters to me?

Where do I belong in the adult world?

How can I contribute meaningfully to society?

What brings value to my world?

While textbooks offer context and insight into the world around and before them, these critical questions cannot be answered through typical education alone. Adolescents need real opportunities to test themselves, encounter limits, take responsibility, and experience the consequences of their actions.

It is worth mentioning that limits and consequences are frequently accompanied by failure. Despite failure’s status in many spheres as an unacceptable curse word, any adult can tell a casual observer that it is an inevitable part of life. How do Montessori guides enable teens to constructively address failure, especially if they have been sheltered from it since infancy?

How do Montessori guides enable teens to constructively address failure, especially if they have been sheltered from it since infancy?

Adolescents will inevitably fail, but they must do so in an environment that doesn’t result in a deep-rooted fear of failure. Without intervention, such a fear could evolve into a more debilitating dread of taking on new challenges and prevent these future adults from developing the growth mindset that is essential to their valorization. At the adolescent level, with careful planning (informed by rigorous observation), opportunities are created for teens to take risks and experience failure in a fairly low-stakes environment. This failure, while certainly feeling impactful for the adolescents themselves, is usually limited to those related to academic, physical, and relationship challenges.

Montessori believed that work provides the mirror adolescents need to discover not only skills but also character. She called this process valorization: the development of a sense of self-worth through meaningful contribution. Notably, whether or not something counts as ‘meaningful contribution’ is not determined by its ability to result in good grades or to inspire praise, but by how much it matters. Ideally, this work not only matters to the student but also to a larger group. Students are put in a position in which others depend on them, and they, therefore, have the opportunity to experience the benefits of success and the consequences of unreliability.

What Real-World Work Looks Like

Montessori Adolescent programs don’t simply send students out to “get jobs.” The work of the Secondary environment is carefully chosen, supervised, and connected to academic learning.

Students run real businesses, such as cafés, farm stands, service ventures, tutoring services, and childcare. They experience situations in which they have the opportunity

to handle actual money or exchange currency, engage with customers and clients, and even learn about business-specific components, such as inventory, profit, and loss.

Many Adolescent Montessori programs offer (and sometimes require) the opportunity to participate in an internship program. The students may spend regular time in internships at places such as veterinary clinics, law offices, elementary schools, nonprofit organizations, co-ops, and design studios, contributing meaningfully to the business with professional guidance. Many programs include landbased work, such as farming, gardening, or environmental restoration, where students’ effort produces visible, tangible results.

The common thread of these experiences is responsibility. Outcomes matter. Other people depend on them. Their effort contributes directly to results. Students are allowed to answer the questions posed above: Who am I becoming? What matters to me? Where do I belong in the adult world? How can I contribute meaningfully? What brings value to my world? Students are encouraged to participate in different activities and, while they may not discover their lifelong passion or calling, these experiences serve to add insight into the direction (or directions) they want to pursue as they continue their journey into adulthood.

Why This Isn’t Vocational Training

Parents sometimes worry that this approach sounds like vocational education. It isn’t.

The goal of these real-world work experiences is not to prepare adolescents for specific careers. Rather, it is to help them develop capacities and transferable skills that will benefit them in any future path: perseverance, realistic self-knowledge, clear communication, collaboration, problem-solving, and resilience.

Through real work, adolescents discover what genuinely interests them and what doesn’t. They learn how organizations actually function. They experience manageable failure and learn to recover, reflect, adjust, and try again. They learn how to work with others in contexts that more closely mirror those that they will encounter in their professional, adult lives.

Most Montessori adolescents go on to attend academically rigorous high schools and colleges. This type of work doesn’t replace academics; instead, it provides context, motivation, and purpose to learning that classroom instruction alone often lacks.

How Academics Fit In

In contrast with traditional education programs, Montessori Adolescent programs aim to integrate academics with work rather than teaching them separately.

Running a business creates genuine mathematical needs: calculating costs, managing cash flow, analyzing profit, and forecasting demand. Writing becomes purposeful when students draft proposals, communicate with customers, and reflect on internships. In this environment, economics, history, and science become lived experiences rather than abstract concepts.

As a result, instead of asking Why do I need to learn this? adolescent students see how knowledge functions in the real world, and their motivation shifts from external pressure to internal relevance.

What This Develops That Classrooms Often Don’t

Sustained real-world work builds capacities that traditional classrooms struggle to cultivate:

• Initiative: seeing what needs doing and acting without being told;

• Time management – meeting deadlines that aren’t negotiable;

• Authentic collaboration – everyone’s contribution truly matters.

• Professional identity – seeing oneself as capable of contributing to adult work.

• Confidence – earned from accomplishment, not praise.

Perhaps, most importantly, adolescents develop resilience. They encounter challenges in manageable doses and learn, through experience (including failure), that they can recover, adapt, keep going, improve, and ultimately succeed.

What About College?

This is often parents’ central concern: Will this prepare my child for competitive high schools and colleges? The integration of work and academics doesn’t weaken preparation; it strengthens it. While many schools still value the high GPA, more and more schools are looking for students that took on greater challenges, even if doing so had a higher likelihood of failure and imperfection. Many guidance counselors and admissions committees are now looking for students who can finish college, rather than simply get in. These real-world experiences provide the skills needed for success in a world no longer structured by parents or teachers.

In this regard, Montessori adolescents usually stand out. They speak with maturity and clarity about their experiences. They demonstrate genuine interest in hobbies rather than engaging in activities solely for their résumé-building value. They show strong work habits, self-direction, and realistic self-knowledge, qualities colleges increasingly value.

What Parents Can Expect to Observe

If you’re wondering whether your adolescent is truly benefiting in their Montessori Secondary program, you should look for the following: increased engagement with their work; growing competence and independence; thoughtful self-assessment; and genuine pride in meaningful contributions. These indicators suggest that students’ work is doing what Montessori intended: supporting development of identity, confidence, and purpose alongside academic growth.

When observing and interacting with your teens, this rich development may appear as contentment, happiness, or pride. However, like all other humans, your adolescent may not display these emotions one-hundred percent of the time. Nevertheless, consistent interaction and engagement with your teen will reveal that these emotions are present and, frequently, that they are partly tied to the work they are doing in their Montessori program.

Trusting the Adolescent Process

Montessori’s approach asks parents to trust something that looks very different from conventional schooling. It rests on a simple belief: Adolescents grow not just by absorbing information, but by testing themselves against reality.

Young people who emerge from Secondary Montessori experiences tend to know who they are, what they can do, and how to contribute meaningfully to their community. They’re prepared not only for the next stage of schooling but also to be engaged and capable young adults living a purposeful life. In a world that is rapidly changing, is increasingly accessible to vast amounts of information and technology, and requires skills we cannot yet imagine, this kind of preparation may be the most important education of all. 

    content: `How Mixed-Age Montessori Classrooms Support Social and Moral Development

One of the first questions many parents ask about Montessori is whether mixed-age classrooms are used. Children ages three to six learn together, sharing the same space, materials, and daily rhythms. Parents naturally wonder: Will younger children be overwhelmed? Will older children be held back? How does this actually work socially?

These are reasonable questions, especially for those of us

who grew up in traditional, same-age classrooms. Montessori, however, is grounded in a different understanding of how children develop—not only academically but also socially and morally. The mixed-age classroom is not simply an instructional choice. It is a carefully designed social environment intended to help children learn to live with others.

A Classroom that Reflects Real Life

Outside of school, children are rarely grouped strictly by age. Families include siblings of different ages. Neighborhoods and communities are naturally mixed. Montessori classrooms intentionally mirror this reality.

Within a three-year age span, children experience themselves in different roles. One year, they are new and learning; later, they become confident helpers and leaders. No child is always the youngest or always the most capable.

This balance reduces unhealthy comparison and allows confidence and humility to grow side by side.

Leadership Grows Naturally

In a mixed-age Montessori classroom, leadership is not assigned by adults. It emerges from competence. Older children help younger ones because they can—and because they remember what it felt like to struggle.

You might see a five-year-old patiently showing a younger child how to roll a rug, or a four-year-old helping a threeyear-old complete a puzzle. These moments are not staged. They occur because children feel ownership of their environment and a sense of responsibility for one another.

This kind of leadership builds empathy. Younger children learn that asking for help is safe. Older children learn that knowledge carries responsibility. Both age groups come to see learning as something shared rather than competitive.

Conflict as a Learning Opportunity

When children of different ages share a space for several years, conflict is inevitable—and valuable. Montessori does not try to eliminate conflict.

Instead, guides help children work through it respectfully.

Montessori classrooms do not rely on reward charts, public praise, or artificial incentives to encourage good behavior. Instead, values are embedded in daily life.

A younger child may want a material that someone else is using. They learn to wait, ask, or choose something else. The older child learns to finish their work thoughtfully and return materials so others may use them. Over time, children learn that their choices affect the community.

These everyday moments are how moral reasoning develops. Children are not lectured about fairness or kindness. They experience what cooperation feels like—and what happens when it breaks down.

How Character Is Built

Montessori classrooms do not rely on reward charts, public praise, or artificial incentives to encourage good behavior. Instead, values are embedded in daily life.

Children wait because the community matters.

They care for materials because other children depend

on them.

They speak respectfully because relationships endure.

They help because they belong together.

Over time, external guidance becomes internal understanding. Children begin to act considerately, not to please adults but because it feels right.

What Parents Often See—and Miss

From the outside, Montessori classrooms usually appear calm and simple. Children work independently or in small groups without constant adult direction. What may not be immediately visible is the complex social learning taking place beneath the surface.

When an older child patiently teaches a younger one, they are learning responsibility and self-control. When younger children watch attentively, they are developing trust in their own future growth.

Parents sometimes worry that younger children will struggle or older children will be bored. More often, younger children feel inspired, and older children feel purposeful. Each child matters—not only for what they receive but also for what they contribute.

Partnering with Your Child’s Montessori Guide

If you are curious about how your own child is navigating the mixed-age environment, your Montessori guide is your best resource. Guides observe social development over extended periods and can provide insights that may not be apparent at home.

They see the shy child beginning to speak up, the impatient child learning to wait, the confident child learning gentleness.

In a mixed-age Montessori classroom, children are learning far more than academics. They are learning how to live with others—and how to act with integrity when no one is watching. That, ultimately, is education at its deepest level. `,

    content: `DEAR CATHIE—

I WISH I COULD MOTIVATE MY CHILD TO DO WHAT I WANT HIM TO DO. THESE THINGS ARE USUALLY THE BASICS OF LIFE, LIKE DRESSING, EATING, TAKING A BATH, AND USING THE BATHROOM BEFORE WE LEAVE THE HOUSE, COMING WHEN HE IS CALLED, AND GETTING INTO THE CAR MORE QUICKLY. I FIND MYSELF GETTING UPSET AND RAISING MY VOICE. I REALLY DON’T WANT TO BE A MOM WHO YELLS AT HER CHILD TO GET HIM TO DO WHAT HE SHOULD DO! I WONDER IF IT WOULD HELP IF I BRIBED HIM. I HAVE HEARD OF STICKER SYSTEMS WHERE THE CHILD “EARNED’ A STICKER OR A STAR FOR DOING WHAT HE WAS SUPPOSED TO DO. THEN, AFTER 5 OR SO STICKERS, HE GETS A TRIP TO THE ICE CREAM STORE, A SPECIAL PRIZE, OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I KNOW THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW ON THIS. WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS?

—A FRAZZLED MOM

Dear Mom,

I think all parents feel the way you do at some point during the day. It is very challenging to get through the days with the children cooperating smoothly most of the time. And while we would so like them to respond more quickly and do what they are told, the truth is that these skills take time to develop for many children. Children need to learn the value of cooperation and their role within the family.

We ultimately want children to be motivated to do the right thing because it is the right thing, not because they will get a “pay-off” for doing it. Getting a “payoff” makes a child think that the reason to get dressed, eat, and come when they are called is to earn a reward rather than to learn to be a self-sufficient human being and a contributing member of their family. Then they do not feel obligated to comply if there is no external reward. And once you begin this kind of system, it is often difficult to stop.

The major negative side of using stars and stickers to control your child’s behavior is twofold. First, your child is being controlled by external forces…. You! It puts you in the role of judge and jury, ruling on your child’s actions and passing judgment on his behavior. The other issue is that it does not actively help your child develop internal motivation. I think it is far better to help him learn to do what is right because it feels good to do what is

I think this is a dangerous path to begin to pursue.

It is better for the optimal independence and personal development of a typically developing child to help him learn to handle the expectations of life and do what is expected, because it is just a natural part of life. While using stars and stickers may seem like a “quick fix,” it is actually more negative than positive in the long run. There are many interesting studies on the longitudinal value of external rewards on children’s performance.

For further reading on this subject, I recommend: Punished by Rewards: The Trouble with Gold Stars, Incentive Plans, A’s, Praise, and Other Bribes by Alfie Kohn and Unconditional Parenting: Moving from Rewards and Punishments to Love and Reason by Alfie Kohn.

As an alternative, I suggest using logical consequences and rewards to help children comply. “As soon as everyone is ready, we can use any extra time to read a story.” “Let’s hurry and get in the car so we have time to drive by the cows on our way to school.” This not only gives the child motivation but also the promise of a positive shared experience within the family. 

    content: `A New Kind of Questioning

Children between the ages of six and twelve are in one of the most remarkable periods of development. It is during these years that their brains can imagine times, places, and people beyond their immediate experiences and the physical world. They arrive at school brimming with questions that stretch a brain that is hungry to imagine and understand. Why do leaves change color? How did the first language begin? Did humans create fire or discover it? What makes thunder? Who invented money? Their minds no longer settle for quick answers. They want to know how things connect, why events happen, and where humanity fits in the grand story of life.

This is what Maria Montessori referred to as the Second Plane of Development. It’s a time of enormous change. Children grow in confidence, abstract reasoning, and moral awareness. Their social lives expand, and their curiosity deepens. For Montessori educators, this is the moment when curiosity meets capability—and the Elementary program is uniquely designed to meet it.

 

The Psychology of the Elementary Child

Children in this stage are dramatically different from their younger peers. Their world expands from the self to the group, and there is a new hunger for shared experiences.  They thrive in collaboration. You’ll often find them gathered around large tables, sprawled on the floor with maps, or debating over how to divide tasks for a project. Their friendships evolve in complexity, and they start to challenge the rules of fairness, justice, and loyalty. This is a period when their own personalities and group members begin to take shape. Moral reasoning starts to bloom. A child who once followed rules simply because “that’s what you do” now questions whether those rules are fair. They want to talk about justice and responsibility, weighing what’s right and wrong in ways that mirror adult conversations. At the same time, their ability to think abstractly begins to expand. While they still love to work with their hands, they are also eager to grasp big concepts, such as civilizations rising and falling, the laws of physics, and the evolution of life. They are drawn to heroes—both real and imagined— who embody courage, resilience, and human greatness.

Did you know?

Developmental psychologists note that, between ages 6 and 12, children experience what Jean Piaget called the “concrete operational stage.” They are increasingly able to reason logically, understand cause and effect, and imagine perspectives beyond their own. Montessori’s approach aligns beautifully with these cognitive leaps. Furthermore, other developmental psychologists, such as Erik Erikson, described these years as ones where students have the psychosocial task of developing industry through work, versus the sense of inferiority, leading to the lifelong “virtue” of competency that will lead them into the early stages of adolescence, young adulthood, and eventual full adulthood.

The Montessori Elementary Approach

To meet the needs of these growing minds, the Montessori Elementary curriculum provides a learning experience that is both structured and expansive. At its heart are the Five Great Lessons, sweeping stories that serve as a unifying framework for everything that follows.

• The Story of the Universe introduces the origins of stars, planets, and the conditions for life.

• The Coming of Life traces the evolutionary journey of living organisms across billions of years.

• The Arrival of Humans explores what makes our species unique—our ability to imagine, communicate, and create culture.

• The Story of Communication in Signs follows the birth of language and writing.

• The Story of Numbers reveals humanity’s inventive ways of measuring, recording, and understanding the world.

These stories don’t just deliver facts. They are intended to be impressionistic. They ignite wonder. They provide a framework for children to see how science, history, math, and language are interconnected. Instead of isolated subjects, children experience knowledge as a web—alive, connected, and ever-expanding. Perhaps more important than what is mentioned above is the sense of appreciation that these lessons are intended to instill.

The late Montessorian Dr. Michael Dorer, author of The Deep Well of Time, among other great Montessori books, often mentioned that the Great Lessons (in addition to providing a framework for the Elementary years) give context and relevance to the curriculum. This helps children develop a deep sense of appreciation for everything that came before them, affecting almost all aspects of our lives, including digital technology and electronics.

One Parent’s Story: Wonder in Action

Jacob, age seven, listened to the Story of the Universe and went home buzzing with questions. That weekend, he built a three-dimensional solar system out of clay, complete with asteroid belts and moons. His parents were astonished by how deeply he absorbed the story. “It wasn’t homework,” his father, Scott, said. “It was joy. He wanted to know everything.”

Beyond the Classroom Walls

Montessori Elementary education doesn’t stop at the school doors. Students design and implement “going out” experiences: student-led trips to libraries, museums, businesses, and nature preserves. Unlike traditional field trips, these outings begin with a child’s question: What was daily life like in Ancient Egypt? How does a printing press work? What kinds of birds live in our county? The children often play a significant role in planning their trip, helping to set an agenda, and learning to navigate real-world logistics, such as writing letters, making calls, managing money, and practicing courtesy with adults in the broader community. These experiences cultivate independence and give them a sense that the whole world is their classroom.

Going Out: The concept of “going out” originates from Maria Montessori, who believed that the prepared environment for older children extended beyond the classroom to encompass the entire community.

Supporting Abstract Thinking

As children grow, their thinking shifts toward more abstract concepts. Montessori materials evolve alongside them, offering bridges from hands-on experiences to symbolic reasoning. As students progress through Elementary and into Montessori Secondary programs, the prepared learning environment becomes less based on materials and physical learning “tools” and more about the prepared opportunity for learning through research, discussion, or experience.

The following materials and curricular areas illustrate how the Elementary Montessori curriculum supports students' cognitive abilities and interests during this second plane.

The Timeline of Life stretches across the classroom floor, making billions of years of evolutionary history tangible.

Mathematical materials shift from beads and cubes to algebraic formulas, preparing children for higher-level reasoning and problem solving. In the Elementary Montessori curriculum, Dr. Montessori considered geometry and arithmetic as related but separate curricular areas, where students learn the characteristics of shapes and then add the ability to quantify value, such as area and volume, through their discovery of the relationship of quantity and size.

Language studies expand to etymology, grammar, and literature, helping children appreciate the richness of communication.

Cultural charts illuminate the rise of civilizations, trade, and human innovation.

A Montessori classroom at this level is alive with research. Children write reports, create models, stage debates, and prepare presentations for peers. Instead of memorizing information for tests, they engage with knowledge in ways that make it meaningful and lasting.

A Collaborative Environment

Elementary Montessori classrooms are designed to encourage collaborative learning. Elementary classrooms often have large tables that invite group work, while open floor space allows for projects that sprawl. Children divide tasks, solve disagreements, and learn to appreciate diverse perspectives. Peer teaching thrives. Older students guide younger ones, reinforcing their knowledge while modeling leadership. A 12-year-old explaining fractions to an 8-year-old doesn’t just strengthen math skills; it builds patience, empathy, and confidence.

One Parent’s Story: A Different Kind of Classroom

A mother visiting her daughter’s classroom was startled to see a group of nine-year-olds leading a lesson on the American Revolution. “I thought, where’s the teacher? Then I realized that the teacher was guiding from the side, and the students were taking ownership of the learning. It was inspiring.”

Academic Rigor with Meaning

Parents sometimes wonder whether Montessori Elementary prepares children academically. The answer is an emphatic yes. Mathematics progresses from concrete exploration to geometry, pre-algebra, and, in some cases, early calculus concepts. Language studies move from writing simple stories to analyzing grammar, writing essays, and engaging with literature. Science includes classification, chemistry, biology, and physics. History and geography encompass ancient civilizations, cultural development, and the interconnectedness of societies.

Unlike conventional schools, Montessori does not teach these subjects in isolation. They are always connected to a larger story and a greater purpose. This integration ensures that children understand not only what to learn but also why it matters and how it is relevant to their lives and their experience as human beings.

Did You Know? Studies comparing Montessori and conventional students have found that Montessori graduates demonstrate stronger critical thinking, greater creativity, and equal or higher achievement in math and literacy by adolescence (Lillard, A.S., et al., Frontiers in Psychology, 2017).

Outcomes that Last

The benefits of Montessori Elementary extend beyond test scores. Children leave these years with exceptional research and critical thinking skills, the ability to collaborate and lead, strong communication abilities, and the confidence to tackle new challenges. Most importantly, they come away with a genuine love of learning. Elementary Montessori education provides socioemotional opportunities for children to develop the skills they need as they progress to a new level of emotional awareness. As these students enter adolescence, a challenging period in most cases, Montessori Elementary environments aim to prepare them as effectively as possible to understand, accept, and self-regulate their emotions.

One Parent’s Story: Independence Blossoms

One of my parents described her son’s ‘shift’ during the Elementary years: “He started asking questions we couldn’t answer. Instead of waiting for us, he grabbed books, searched online, interviewed neighbors, and even wrote letters to a local historian. Montessori taught him that curiosity isn’t the end of learning—it’s the beginning.” Possibly more important than his desire to learn was his ability to take action on his own to address his own needs, a skill that is possibly more important than any academic accomplishment.

Supporting Your Child’s Montessori Journey

For parents, raising an Elementary-aged Montessori child means embracing their boundless curiosity and growing independence.

Engage with their questions. Instead of rushing to give answers, ask, “What do you think?” or, “Where could we look that up?”

Offering enriching experiences includes museum visits, nature hikes, and cultural festivals—all of which feed the classroom curriculum. Give space for independence.

Allow them to plan family projects, cook meals, or resolve conflicts with siblings.

Respect their social world. Friendships are central at this age, and learning to navigate them is an integral part of the developmental process.

Supporting your child doesn’t mean doing everything for them—it means giving them the room and resources to grow into capable, thoughtful young people.

The Elementary Years as a Foundation

The Elementary years are a time of profound intellectual and social growth.

With Montessori’s unique approach, curiosity and capability come together in powerful ways. Children emerge as independent thinkers, problem solvers, and lifelong learners. At the end of the Elementary years, Montessori children don’t just know facts and figures. They know how to think, collaborate, and maintain their curiosity. That’s a foundation not just for school but for life.

In closing, choosing to have your children continue in Montessori through the Elementary years is a great and BRAVE decision. Elementary Montessori education inspires and encourages questioning, challenging, and advocating. While some might consider these three characteristics as adversarial, many of us believe that these are what evolve into leadership, confidence, and support, possibly exactly what the world needs. It takes brave people to raise Montessori children!

    content: `Recently, we read an opinion piece by Jordan McGillis in The Washington Post (August 18, 2025), titled “Why child care costs so much — and how to fix it.” It raised important points about America’s rising child-care costs and prompted us to reflect on this issue from a Montessori perspective. Why All Child Care Is Expensive

High-quality care is costly everywhere because caring for babies, toddlers, and young children is labor-intensive. There are no shortcuts. Children need attentive adults who respond with warmth, patience, and skill. Economists call this the Baumol effect.

In most industries, technology boosts productivity—factories produce more with fewer workers. But child care is different. It still takes one set of loving arms to rock one baby. A teacher cannot safely guide 20 toddlers at once. The adult-to-child ratio must stay low, which keeps labor costs high.

Meanwhile, fewer Americans are entering Early Childhood education. The pay is modest compared with other professions, despite the extensive training, stamina, and emotional intelligence required. A shortage of qualified caregivers drives up wages further, adding pressure on program budgets.

The Hidden Overhead of Montessori and Other Private Schools

Most Montessori schools in the U.S. are private and tuition- driven. They face the same challenges as other childcare centers—plus additional costs unique to their model.

Teacher Education and Salaries

Montessori teachers complete specialized training that can take a year or more and often comes with significant tuition debt. Schools must offer competitive salaries to attract and retain top talent, especially since many public schools provide higher pay and benefits.

Classroom Materials

Montessori classrooms are filled with hands-on learning materials—Golden Beads for math, Sandpaper Letters for literacy, Puzzle Maps, timelines, and science tools. These are durable and beautiful, but also expensive. Equipping one classroom can cost between \$20,000 and \$40,000.

Facilities and Support Staff

Private schools carry mortgage or lease payments, insurance, utilities, and maintenance without government funding to offset costs. They also need administrators, assistants, and specialists to maintain operations. Payroll, benefits, and retirement contributions add up quickly.

Safety and Compliance

Meeting state licensing standards requires investments in security systems, playground equipment, fire alarms, and frequent inspections. In regions prone to hurricanes, wildfires, or earthquakes, insurance premiums can be staggering.

Where Tuition Goes: A Montessori Cost Breakdown

Every school is different, but surveys of Montessori and other independent schools show a fairly consistent breakdown of tuition spending:

• 65% to Staffing (teachers, assistants, administrators): The majority of tuition goes directly to salaries and benefits. Low student-to-teacher ratios, especially in infant and toddler programs, make staffing the most significant expense.

• 20% to Facilities (mortgage, rent, utilities, insurance, maintenance): Maintaining a safe, child-friendly environment comes with high ongoing costs.

• 5% to Educational Materials and Curriculum: Montessori materials are carefully crafted, long-lasting, and often imported.

• 5% to Professional Development: Training Montessori teachers is a continual investment through refresher courses, conferences, and coaching.

• 5% to Other (licensing fees, technology, supplies): From playground upkeep to accreditation to liability coverage, “hidden” expenses add up quickly.

Tuition isn’t padded with excess—it reflects the real costs of providing safe, nurturing, high-quality care.

The Limits of Subsidies

As McGillis noted, subsidies help families manage tuition but don’t reduce the actual cost of care; they shift the expense to taxpayers. Subsidy programs also come with strict regulations: mandated curricula, credential requirements, and extensive reporting. While these rules aim to ensure safety and accountability, they can inadvertently reduce schools' flexibility.

For Montessori programs, heavy regulation can conflict with values, such as individualized learning, freedom within limits, and respect for each child’s natural development.

Ideas That Could Help

The Washington Post article offered several ideas worth considering:

• Expand visa programs. The U.S. could welcome more qualified caregivers from abroad, many of whom are eager to work with children. Montessori schools, in particular, can recruit teachers from Europe, Asia, and Latin America, where training programs are strong.

• Rethink credential barriers. While training is essential, rigid rules can deter passionate caregivers and drive up costs.

• Give families more choice. Not every family wants the same model of care. Greater flexibility, while maintaining safety, would allow Montessori and other approaches to flourish.

Why the Investment Pays Off

The high cost of childcare, particularly for Montessori programs, can be a significant financial burden. Yet these are the years when a child’s foundation for life is built. Neuroscientists confirm that 85 percent of brain growth occurs before age six. Focus, self-regulation, empathy, and problem-solving all emerge from early experiences. When children spend those years in nurturing, well-prepared environments, the long-term benefits ripple outward for decades.

Montessori offers settings where independence, concentration, and curiosity are cultivated daily. A three-year-old carefully pouring water or a five-year-old teaching a younger child how to trace a letter are building confidence, competence, and belonging.

The Bigger Picture

Yes, childcare is expensive. Yes, Montessori tuition can feel daunting. But these costs reflect what it truly takes to offer children high-quality early experiences: skilled teachers, rich materials, safe facilities, and environments designed for growth. For parents, tuition can be seen not only as a bill to be paid, but as an investment—an investment in a child’s lifelong love of learning, resilience, and emotional growth.

As McGillis and others suggest, the challenge lies in expanding the pool of caregivers and reducing barriers that keep good people out of the field. If society can do that, more families will have access to early education options— including Montessori—that honor children’s needs and prepare them for a future full of promise. `,

    content: `A Conversation with Dr. Ann Epstein on Creativity, Thinking, and Memory

By Tim Seldin

I recently had the pleasure of speaking with Dr. Ann Epstein of the University of Wisconsin, a longtime researcher and advocate for high-quality early education. Our conversation turned to some fascinating new studies coming out of Europe and the U.S. that shed light on how different educational approaches actually shape the developing brain. What’s emerging, thanks to researchers like Dr. Solange Denervaud and her colleagues in Switzerland and at Penn State, is compelling scientific evidence for what Montessori educators have observed for over a century: the Montessori approach does more than help children learn well—it appears to support deep, lasting brain development tied to memory, creativity, and flexible thinking.

Dr. Epstein shared two recent studies with me, and I want to pass along what I learned from her. These findings offer new insights—not just affirming what we already know about Montessori education, but potentially helping us understand why it works so well.

Creativity and the Developing Brain: What the Science Shows

The first study Dr. Epstein pointed me to was Creative Thinking and Brain Network Development in Schoolchildren, published in Developmental Science (Duval, Denervaud, et al., 2023). The researchers used both behavioral assessments and fMRI brain scans to compare 75 children aged 4 to 18 from Montessori and traditional schools. The results confirmed what previous research has suggested: Montessori students tend to score higher on measures of creative thinking. But what’s truly remarkable is what was happening in their brains.

Children in Montessori classrooms showed more balanced and flexible activation across three key brain networks involved in creativity:

• The Default Mode Network (DMN), which supports internal thought, imagination, and self-reflection. 

• The Executive Control Network (ECN), which supports working memory and decision-making. 

• The Salience Network (SN), which helps the brain decide what to pay attention to. 

Children from traditional school environments, by contrast, tended to spend more time in a static or introspective mode (high intra-DMN activity), suggesting less flexibility in switching between idea generation and evaluation. Montessori students, meanwhile, moved more fluidly between networks—exactly the kind of dynamic thinking that supports creativity, problem-solving, and adaptability.

This isn't just academic. As Dr. Epstein reminded me, creative thinking is essential—not just for artists or inventors, but for anyone navigating a complex and ever-changing world. And these findings suggest that Montessori schools may be doing something unique to nurture it.

Memory: Learning by Heart or With Heart?

The second study Dr. Epstein shared was Learning by Heart or With Heart: Brain Asymmetry Reflects Pedagogical Practices, published in Brain Sciences (Schetter, Denervaud, et al., 2023). This paper looked at another important dimension: how children remember and organize what they learn.

Using structural MRI scans, the researchers measured differences in the parahippocampal cortex (PHC), a brain region involved in memory and learning. Children in Montessori classrooms showed a developmental trend toward left-hemisphere asymmetry in the PHC—associated with semantic memory (understanding concepts, generalizing ideas). In contrast, children from traditional schools showed right-hemisphere asymmetry—linked to episodic memory (recalling specific events or rote sequences).

What does that mean? According to Dr. Epstein, the data suggest that Montessori children are more likely to encode meaning, while children in traditional classrooms are more likely to recall isolated facts or events. It’s a difference between knowing and understanding—and it shows up in the structure of the brain.

Montessori students also tend to perform better on recognition tasks and show more interconnected and flexible semantic networks, according to earlier research by Denervaud and colleagues. That flexibility—how easily children link ideas together and transfer learning from one context to another—is at the heart of real-world problem-solving.

Why Might Montessori Make a Difference?

As Dr. Epstein and I discussed, the studies don’t claim that Montessori is the only path to healthy brain development. But they do suggest that some key features of Montessori classrooms may be contributing to these positive outcomes:

• Multi-age classrooms and peer collaboration, which support social-emotional development and flexible thinking. 

• Uninterrupted work periods, which promote sustained attention and deeper engagement. 

• Freedom of movement and choice, which align with how the brain learns best: through agency and active exploration. 

• Respectful adult-child relationships, where teachers serve as guides rather than lecturers—a factor Angeline Lillard highlights in The Montessori Handbook (Bloomsbury, 2021). 

• Calm, well-ordered environments, which reduce behavioral disruptions and allow children to focus, regulate, and retain more of what they learn. 

From Dr. Epstein’s perspective, one of the most interesting questions ahead is why these differences arise. Is it the materials? The mixed-age grouping? The training of the teacher? Likely, it’s the synergy of all of the above. Montessori isn’t just a set of techniques—it’s a whole system designed around how children actually grow and learn.

A Word of Caution—and of Encouragement

It’s important to note, as Dr. Epstein emphasized, that this research is still developing. We need longitudinal studies to follow children into adulthood and determine how these early neural patterns play out over time. But even now, these findings offer a rare window into the deeper “how” behind Montessori’s effectiveness.

For parents, it’s an opportunity to see that the choice of school is about more than academics or test scores. Montessori may help your child build a brain that’s not just smarter—but more creative, more adaptable, and more capable of seeing the bigger picture.

And for teachers, these findings can be affirming. What you do each day—the grace with which you guide, the calm you maintain in your classroom, the respect you offer to each child—is quite literally helping shape the architecture of a developing mind.

We’ve always known that Montessori education works. We’ve seen it in the confidence, curiosity, and calm focus of our students. Now, thanks to researchers like Dr. Denervaud and advocates like Dr. Epstein, we’re starting to see why.

And the answer, it seems, is written not just in observation notes or test scores—but in the very folds and rhythms of the growing brain.

 

If you're curious to learn more about these studies, I encourage you to watch the video summary from Dr. Denervaud’s team on creativity and the brain: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWV_5o8wB5g. Or, better yet, talk with your child’s Montessori teacher. They’re your partner in this extraordinary journey.`,

    content: `A New Chapter in Development

The years from 12 to 18 are among the most intense and transformative in a young person’s life. Adolescence brings rapid growth—not only in the body but also in how young people think, feel, and connect with others. They test boundaries, challenge assumptions, and search for meaning.

Maria Montessori described this as the Third Plane of Development, a turning point that requires education to change in both style and purpose.

In the early years, children seek independence through action.

In the elementary years, it becomes independence of thought.

In adolescence, the need shifts to self-independence—forming identity, belonging, and purpose.

The questions change, too. They no longer ask how the world works. They ask who I am. Where do I belong? What difference can I make?

The Psychology of the Adolescent 

Psychologists note that adolescence is a time of heightened self-consciousness. Teens measure themselves against peers and grapple with fairness, values, and justice. Friends exert significant influence, even as adolescents begin to form their own ideals.

The physical changes are pronounced, and emotions can fluctuate from high to low within hours. Beneath that turbulence lies a striving for balance, integrity, and authenticity.

Did You Know? Neuroscience shows that the adolescent brain undergoes a second major growth spurt. The prefrontal cortex—the region responsible for judgment and decision-making—is being rewired. This explains both teens’ risk-taking and their vast capacity for creativity, leadership, and innovation.

The Montessori Approach to Adolescent Education

Montessori recognized that adolescents require a distinct approach from Primary or Elementary education—an environment that eases the transition from childhood to adulthood.

The best Montessori Secondary programs rest on three essentials:

• Work with purpose. Adolescents thrive when trusted with meaningful work—running a small business, creating art, farming, or organizing community projects.

• Community life. Adolescents need belonging. Cooperative projects, service learning, and residential experiences foster empathy and responsibility.

• Exploration of identity. Through literature, science, history, and the arts, students explore humanity’s story, connect with role models, and form their own ideals.

A Parent’s Story: Becoming More Responsible. One parent reported that her 14-year-old daughter participated in a micro-economy project, selling handmade products at a local market. “She came home explaining supply and demand and profit margins,” her mother said. “But what struck me most was her pride. She wasn’t pretending to be grown up—she was contributing something real.”

Academics with Context 

Montessori adolescent programs don’t dilute academics—they make them relevant—mathematics links to economics, science to ecology, history to social justice. Adolescents stay motivated when they understand why knowledge matters. Language work expands into persuasive essays, debates, and close readings. Science explores ecosystems, physiology, and chemistry labs. History becomes a study of human struggles for survival, justice, and meaning.

Did You Know? Research shows students retain more knowledge when it connects to their lives (National Research Council, How People Learn, 2000).

Montessori anticipated this a century ago by grounding academics in real-world experience.

Work Beyond the Classroom

As in the elementary years, adolescents extend learning into the wider world—but with greater responsibility. Programs often include farm work, internships, apprenticeships, and service projects that offer real experiences, not simulations. Some schools operate small farms or gardens, where students care for animals, plant crops, and sell produce. Others partner with local businesses or nonprofits. These experiences build practical skills and a deep sense of competence.

A Parent’s Story: Seeing the Bigger Picture One father described his son’s work at a school “land-lab.” “He used to roll his eyes at chores,” he said. “But after feeding animals and planting crops, he came home eager to cook, fix things, and pitch in. He felt useful—and that changed his whole outlook.”

“Adolescence is often described as turbulent, but it is also filled with extraordinary potential.”

 

 

The Social World of Adolescents 

More than at any other age, adolescents live in a world defined by peers. Friendships can feel like lifelines, and social belonging is central to their well-being. Montessori embraces this energy, weaving it into learning. Collaborative projects, discussions, and shared responsibilities help adolescents practice empathy, navigate conflict, and experience authentic leadership.

Supporting Adolescents at Home 

Parenting during adolescence can feel like a balancing act— offering guidance while allowing independence. Montessori parents can support this stage by:

Encouraging responsibility through chores, part-time work, or family contributions.

Respecting growing independence while maintaining consistent boundaries.

Listening more than lecturing—adolescents want to be heard.

Sharing stories of role models and heroes who embody strong values.

 

A Parent’s Story: Building Trust One mother said her 15-year-old son began challenging family rules. “We started holding family meetings. He helped set expectations, and suddenly, he was more willing to follow them. He needed to know his voice counted.”

 

Outcomes of Montessori Secondary Programs

Montessori graduates carry more than academic preparation. They leave with a strong sense of identity, purpose, and responsibility. They know how to manage projects, collaborate, and contribute to their communities.

Research on Montessori alumni shows lasting strengths in creativity, collaboration, and satisfaction with learning. Most importantly, they keep their curiosity alive.

 

Did You Know? Montessori called adolescent programs Erdkinder— schools for “children of the earth.” She envisioned farm-based communities where study was balanced with practical work. Not every modern school fully adheres to this model, but its principles of meaningful work, community, and identity remain central.

In Summary Adolescence is often described as turbulent, but it is also filled with extraordinary potential. Montessori sees this age not as something to endure but as something to celebrate. By offering meaningful work, genuine community, and opportunities to explore identity, Montessori schools help adolescents transition into adulthood with confidence and purpose. By the time they leave, Montessori adolescents carry not only knowledge but also a deep understanding of themselves and their world—a foundation for resilience, purpose, and a meaningful life. `,

    content: `Understanding How Your Child Learns

One of the most fascinating and vital concepts in Montessori education is the understanding of how children learn in their early years — specifically, through what Dr. Maria Montessori termed the “Absorbent Mind” and “Sensitive Periods”. 

If you’ve ever watched your child eagerly repeat a task — like pouring water over and over or asking you to read the same book nightly — you’ve witnessed these phenomena in action. 

Understanding the Absorbent Mind and Sensitive Periods not only sheds light on your child’s development but also helps you respond in ways that deeply support their growth. 

Let’s explore these two intertwined ideas, what they mean for your child, and how you can nurture them at home. 

What is the Absorbent Mind? Dr. Maria Montessori coined the term “Absorbent Mind” to describe the unique, sponge-like capacity of children from birth to age 6 to absorb knowledge, behaviors, and experiences directly from their environment without conscious effort. 

In these early years, children aren’t learning in the way adults do — by studying, memorizing, or rehearsing. Instead, they are unconsciously and effortlessly absorbing everything around them: language, movement, culture, social norms, and even the emotional climate of their home. 

Dr. Montessori wrote: “The child absorbs these impressions not with his mind but with his life itself.” There are two phases of the Absorbent Mind: • Unconscious Absorbent Mind (Birth to 3 years): The child is passively soaking up everything in their environment. 

This is when language, motor coordination, and emotional impressions are internalized rapidly and deeply. 

• Conscious Absorbent Mind (3 to 6 years): The child begins to seek experiences and deliberately repeat activities to master skills. Curiosity drives exploration and refinement. Understanding this helps explain why the early years are so crucial — and why Montessori environments, including your home, play such a vital role. 

What are Sensitive Periods? 

Within the broad landscape of the Absorbent Mind are specific Sensitive Periods — unique windows of time when the child is especially attuned to learning particular skills. During these periods, children exhibit intense interest, attention, and a capacity for mastery in specific areas. Once a Sensitive Period passes, the same learning can still occur, but it will require more effort and may lack the same natural enthusiasm.

Learning manners, social norms, and empathy Each period is characterized by focus, persistence, and joy in repeating related activities. For example, a child in the Sensitive Period for order might become upset if their toys are rearranged unexpectedly — not because they are fussy, but because their developing mind is constructing an internal sense of order. 

How this plays out in Montessori classrooms 

Montessori guides are trained to observe and respond to these Sensitive Periods with the right materials and activities at the right time. 

For instance: 

• A child showing keen interest in sounds might be introduced to Sound Cylinders to refine auditory discrimination. 

• A child in the Sensitive Period for language is offered Sandpaper Letters and storytelling to enrich vocabulary and phonetic awareness. 

• Children refining their movement are guided toward Practical Life activities, such as spooning, pouring, and using tongs. 

The environment is designed to align with these developmental windows, ensuring that children experience deep, joyful learning. 

As a parent, you play a crucial role in supporting the Absorbent Mind and Sensitive Periods at home. You don't need specialized materials to support these developmental phases; although some Montessori-inspired tools can be helpful. 

Here's how you can nurture your child's sensitive periods in daily life. 

1. Sensitive Period for Order • Establish consistent routines — including morning rituals, meals, and bedtime — at predictable times. 

• Keep belongings in designated areas — have a basket for shoes and a hook for jackets. 

• Involve your child in organizing — such as sorting laundry, matching socks, and setting the table. 

Resource Tip: Read Simplicity Parenting by Kim John Payne, which offers guidance on creating order and rhythm in family life.

The Key Sensitive Periods and Their Age Ranges

Sensitive Period Approximate Age Range What the Child is Drawn To

Order Birth to ~3 years Consistency, routines, and organization of the environment

Language Birth to ~6 years Listening, speaking, expanding vocabulary, sounds, and writing

Movement (Gross & Fine) Birth to ~4.5 years Control of the body, coordination, and manipulating objects

Refinement of the Senses ~2 to 6 years Discriminating sound, texture, color, shape, smell

Small Objects ~1.5 to 4 years Fascination with tiny details and objects

Social Behavior/Grace & Courtesy ~2.5 to 6 years Learning manners, social norms, and empathy

Observation: The Key to Supporting Sensitive Periods

Dr. Montessori emphasized the importance of observation.

At home, take time to watch your child play and explore:

• What tasks do they repeat?

• What objects capture their attention?

• Are they sensitive to changes in routine or environment?

Your observations will help you provide the appropriate experiences at the appropriate time.

In Closing

Your child’s mind is not just learning — it is building who they will become. The Absorbent Mind and Sensitive Periods are nature’s way of ensuring children acquire the skills, knowledge, and attitudes they need to thrive — with joy and ease. By observing and supporting these phases, both at your child’s Montessori school and at home, we can provide an enriching, respectful path that honors the wonder of childhood.

 Reflection Questions for Parents 

Have I noticed my child repeating certain actions or showing a strong interest in specific tasks? 

Is my home environment prepared to allow my child to explore these interests freely? 

How can I enrich my child’s day with more opportunities aligned with their sensitive period?

    content: `Family life is characterized by gatherings that celebrate milestones—weddings, anniversaries, birthdays, holidays, and rites of passage. These occasions strengthen intergenerational bonds, root children in family traditions, and create memories that last a lifetime.

Depending on your family’s customs, beliefs, and cultural background, these moments often include special ceremonies that give the event shape and meaning.

From a Montessori perspective, celebrations are opportunities for children to feel included, contribute meaningfully, and connect their unfolding story to the larger story of family and culture. The key is to invite participation at a level that respects both their developmental stage and growing independence.

Handmade Gifts: A Child’s Contribution 

Many celebrations include the exchange of gifts. While store-bought presents are common, families can also create traditions of giving handmade ones. Children love preparing something with their own hands, and Montessori emphasizes meaningful work. Even very young children can help bake cookies, roll candles, or mix homemade ice cream. Older children might sew a doll, paint a picture, or prepare a basket planted with herbs. With guidance, they can frame artwork, write and illustrate poems, or assemble a scrapbook of family photos.

Some families with teenagers undertake larger “secret” projects—building a dollhouse or model train set — as unforgettable gifts for younger siblings.

Creating and giving handmade items teaches that love and effort matter more than price tags and offers the deep satisfaction of seeing their work valued by those they love most.

Special Anniversaries: Building Family History. Anniversaries remind children that family stories stretch back before their own memories. Parents who share photos and stories of their wedding day show children the roots of their family tree. A simple meal, a candlelit dessert, or a shared story can make anniversaries meaningful, even for the youngest family members. Milestone anniversaries—25, 40, or 50 years together— often include extended family and friends. Inviting children to help decorate, make cards, or create a slideshow strengthens their sense of belonging to something larger than themselves.

Birthdays: A Montessori Tradition. Birthdays are especially powerful because they honor the day a life began. In Montessori classrooms, the birthday “walk around the sun” is a cherished ritual that families can adapt at home. Place a candle in the center of the room to represent the sun. Give the child a globe to carry around the circle, one lap for each year of life. As the child walks, parents share a photo and short story from each year—reminding everyone of the journey so far.

Some families add a candle lit at breakfast and kept burning throughout the day. At dinner, gather to reflect: What were the highlights of the past year? What are your hopes for the year ahead? This turns birthdays into more than a party—it makes them a moment of reflection, gratitude, and connection. 

Another lovely tradition is preparing a time capsule: letters from parents, photos, drawings, or small treasures sealed each year and given to the child on their 18th or 21st birthday— a treasure chest of memories.

Rites of Passage: Joy and Sorrow Every family experiences rites of passage—baptisms, confirmations, bar and bat mitzvahs, graduations, weddings, funerals, and memorials. Some are joyful, others sorrowful, but all are significant. The challenge is deciding how much a child can participate. Long ceremonies or formal dinners may be overwhelming for the very young. Parents can plan for children to attend part of the event and leave with a caregiver before fatigue sets in. The goal is to let children share in family life while respecting their limits. With preparation and sensitivity, these moments help children understand life’s rhythm—celebration, remembrance, and continuity.

Real Families, Real Traditions: Holiday Traditions. Some families establish new traditions every year. One year, everyone created illustrated gratitude books to share at dinner. Another year, we smashed our Halloween pumpkins the next day and let the seeds take root. Our children love reminiscing and inventing new ideas. Following their lead fills our holidays with joy.

To Wrap Up

Children thrive when they are included in family life in ways that honor their developmental stage. Celebrations—large or small, joyful or solemn—offer belonging and continuity. By letting them help, create, and participate, we invite them into the ongoing story of family and culture. From handmade gifts to time-honored rituals, from birthdays to anniversaries, each occasion strengthens bonds and passes on tradition. As Montessori reminds us, children are always building themselves. Family celebrations help give them the roots and wings they need for the journey ahead.`,

A PROACTIVE MOM

 

Dear Mom,

I applaud you for already considering the challenging issues. Bullying is a highly discussed topic now, and many schools, religious organizations, and community groups are working hard to raise awareness and develop training and interventions to counteract this behavior!

There are mixed views about the reality of bullying in preschool. I am in the camp that some children begin to show signs of bullying behavior as young as three, and these behaviors need to be addressed as soon as they appear.

Luckily, Montessori guides are trained to do just that. We are trained to work with children in challenging interpersonal situations and to help both bullies and the bullied develop appropriate actions and responses in social settings.

Let’s look at bullying from a few angles.

• When can bullying begin?

• What does it look like?

• What kinds of interventions are possible with such young children?

 

Children begin to understand and appreciate others' feelings around age 3. Before that age, children are totally self-absorbed. They have limited capacity to put themselves in another person's shoes and understand how that person might feel in a given situation.

The development of empathy is central to social learning in the early years.

What actually constitutes bullying behavior? The answer lies primarily in the motivation for the behavior. If a child deliberately does harm to another and smiles about it, that is bullying. If a child regularly hits, kicks, or punches another, that is bullying. It is also bullying to call another child repeatedly “names,” exclude him from play, or put him down with either words or actions.

It is bullying behavior to recruit other children to misbehave and to sneak to do things. Bullies also intimidate their victims by hurting a child or threatening to hurt a child and demanding that she keep it a secret.

In reality, many preschoolers do engage in some of the behavior listed above. The challenge is to distinguish between typical preschool squabbles and actual bullying.

This is the time in life when children “try out” many types of behavior to learn how to interact with others. They work to understand the impact of their actions and their words.

Preschool children who are just learning to socialize may do things that are thoughtless, unkind, or even downright mean. In an effort to secure a friendship, Samantha may boss Rachel around and get her to do what Samantha tells her to do.

My most memorable story about this was a child who ordered another child to use a specific potty in the school bathroom. Even though it made her friend cry, she was adamant day after day. After discussion, she preferred the child use the potty next to her so they could sit together. “That is what friends do, Miss Cathie, they sit together,” she told me, nodding solemnly. This was not bullying but a misunderstood code of conduct in a friendship. The difference is that the negative consequences of these behaviors do not bring the child satisfaction or joy.

 

One of the main symptoms of bullying behavior is that it is repeated and has a deliberate intent to scare, harm, or upset another. In most preschool conflicts, the power is balanced.

Let’s look at a typical example. David and Paul (both three-year-old boys) are playing in the sandbox. They see a popular red dump truck. They both grab for it, and a conflict begins. “It’s mine! I had it first,” they both cry. One pulls the truck, and the other falls over crying. The child has his truck, and he walks away, leaving the crying child in the sandbox. This conflict will take some teacher interaction to resolve, but it is not bullying. Neither boy wanted to harm the other.

Learning to share, take turns, and care about others' feelings is an important component of preschool social learning. When working with children to resolve squabbles, I often find they are surprised that their actions caused another child to be upset or cry. They are so egocentric at this age that they only want what they want and focus on getting it, often at the expense of others.

What can you do if you feel there is a bullying situation brewing in your child’s class?

The first step is to gather as much information as possible, then speak with your child’s teacher. While the adults in your child’s classroom are great observers and see much that happens at the school, they are not able to see everything. Therefore, they need your input on how things are affecting your child. Some children are shy, especially in their first year, and do not feel comfortable talking to the teacher. They only share those serious feelings with their parents at home. And a bully may be sneaky, and it may be hard for your child to make sense of the situation.

How do Montessori guides work with children on these skills?

We explain to children that “you can’t have your fun by making other people sad.” This is the basic anti-bullying mantra. When squabbles arise, Montessori works with both children to discuss, analyze, and resolve the conflict. They help each child to listen while the other tells their side of the story and identify the way the conflict made them feel. Then the children and the guide brainstorm for ways to resolve the problem. “What do you need to make you feel better?” is a question we often ask. We expect that the child who was hurt to initiate the conversation. “It is not Ok for anyone to hurt your body or your feelings.” We expect the child who did the hurting to “fix” the problem.

Problems are not left until they are resolved. The child who was hurt (or bullied) is helped to stand up for himself, and the child who was doing the hurting (or bullying) is taught to listen and make amends.

So in the Montessori Method, both types of children are taught anti-bullying strategies.

 

Guides in 3-6 classrooms spend significant time with these sorts of problems. And most children do this sort of self-advocacy independently by the end of their fourth year.

    content: `by Jennifer Chen

Watching my son Jack transition from a wobbly 15-month-old to a confident six-year-old reader has been one of the most incredible journeys of my parenting life. When people ask me about Montessori, I always tell them: It's not just about the materials or the mixed-age classrooms—it's about witnessing your child unfold naturally, at their own perfect pace.

If you're wondering what this journey looks like year by year, here's what I've learned from watching Jack and his classmates grow up Montessori.

The Toddler Years (15 Months to 3 Years): Building the Foundation

Those First Steps Into Independence (15-18 months)

Remember how overwhelming it felt dropping off your baby for the first time? Jack clung to me like a koala for the first week. But his guide, Ms. Anna, was incredibly patient, helping him feel safe while he watched the older toddlers confidently carrying their little trays and wiping up spills.

 

During these early months, you'll see your child:

 Slowly warming up to new routines (yes, there will be tears—yours and theirs!).

 Becoming fascinated with "real work" like spooning beans or carrying water.

 Starting to use words for everything they see and touch.

 Developing those crucial walking skills through all the purposeful movement.

I remember being amazed when Jack, at barely 18 months, insisted on carrying his own lunch tray to the table. At home, I was still carrying everything for him!

The "I Can Do It!" Phase (18-24 months)

This is when things get really exciting. Jack became obsessed with zippers, buttons, and anything that required fine-motor skills. He'd spend twenty minutes working on a single button, completely absorbed. At home, getting dressed took forever because he wanted to do everything himself.

During this phase, you'll notice:

 Your child's confidence soaring as they master new physical skills.

 An explosion of language—new words every single day.

 Growing interest in helping with real tasks (let them help with laundry).

 The beginnings of toilet awareness (but don't stress about timelines).

My friend Sarah laughed that her daughter Maya became the "snack monitor" at 20 months, carefully counting out crackers for her classmates.

The Social Butterfly Emerges (24-36 months)

By two-and-a-half, Jack was a completely different child. He'd bounce into school, chatting with friends and heading straight to his favorite activities. The parallel play of earlier months transformed into genuine friendships.

This final toddler year brings:

 Real conversations and storytelling.

 Mastery of self-care routines (goodbye, diaper changes).

 Artistic expression through painting, clay, and creative play.

 Empathy and kindness toward younger children.

 Growing attention span and focus.

I'll never forget watching Jack comfort a crying friend by bringing him a tissue and sitting quietly beside him. That kind of emotional intelligence develops naturally in this environment.

The Primary Years (Ages 3-6): Where the Magic Happens

Year One: The Wide-Eyed Explorer (Ages 3-4)

Starting Primary felt like entering a magical world. Jack was mesmerized by the older children's confidence and the beautiful materials beckoning from every shelf. Those first months were all about exploration and finding his place in this new community.

During this year, you'll see: z Your child gravitate toward hands-on activities (Jack loved the Pink Tower). z Beginning to trace letters and recognize sounds. z Counting and beginning to understand numbers through concrete materials. z Learning about the world through puzzle maps and nature studies. z Developing grace and courtesy through daily interactions.

The Practical Life work was still Jack's favorite—he'd spend ages polishing silver or arranging flowers, building the concentration and coordination he'd need for later academic work.

Year Two: The Confident Learner (Ages 4-5)

This is when academic learning really takes off, but in the most natural way. Jack started building words with the Moveable Alphabet before he could even write letters. He was reading simple words by Christmas and writing stories by spring.

z Year two typically brings: z Deeper engagement with all subject areas. z Beginning reading and writing. (at their own pace!). z Understanding place value through the famous golden beads. z Exploring science through hands-on experiments. z Taking on more responsibility in the classroom community.

I remember Jack's excitement when he finally mastered the Binomial Cube—a complex three-dimensional puzzle that prepares children for algebra concepts. He was so proud to show me how all the pieces fit together.

Year Three: The Classroom Leader (Ages 5-6)

If you're debating whether to keep your child for the third year, let me tell you: This is when everything comes together. Jack transformed from a student into a teacher, helping younger children and taking genuine ownership of his learning.

The third year is magical because children: z Read fluently and write with confidence. z Understand complex math concepts and can explain them to others. z Lead classroom discussions and help solve conflicts. z Mentor younger children with patience and kindness. z Develop genuine academic confidence and love of learning.

 

Watching Jack teach a three-year-old how to pour water or help a friend sound out a word showed me that he hadn't just learned facts—he'd learned how to learn and how to care for others.

A Typical Day: What Your Child Actually Experiences

The three-hour morning work period is the heart of the Montessori day. Children choose their own activities based on interest and readiness, working alone or with friends. Jack might start with math work, move to reading, then spend time on a geography project—all self-directed.

The day flows naturally:

 Morning greeting and settling into work.

 Individual lessons with the guide.

 

 Snack when hungry (not when the clock says it's time).

 Outdoor exploration and movement

 Group time for stories, songs, and cultural lessons.

 Lunch and rest time.

What I love most is that children aren't rushed from activity to activity. They have time to deeply engage with materials and ideas.

The Beautiful Mixed-Age Magic

One of the most remarkable aspects of Jack's Montessori experience has been watching him grow within the same classroom community. As a three-year-old, he looked up to the six-year-olds with awe. By his third year, he was the one being looked up to.

This progression creates:

 Natural mentoring relationships.

 Genuine leadership opportunities.

 Reduced academic pressure (no single "grade level" to meet).

 Lasting friendships across age groups.

 A true sense of classroom community.

Supporting the Journey at Home

The best thing you can do is trust the process and support your child's growing independence. We set up low shelves with Jack's art supplies, let him help with real household tasks, and read together every single day.

Most importantly, we learned to step back and let Jack struggle through challenges. The patience and problemsolving skills he developed in school transferred beautifully to home life.

The Transformation

Looking back at photos from Jack's first day at 15 months and his Primary graduation at six, I'm amazed by the transformation. He went from a toddler who needed help with everything to a confident, capable child who approaches new challenges with curiosity instead of fear.

But the real magic isn't just in what he learned—it's in who he became. He's kind, thoughtful, and genuinely excited about learning. He can focus deeply on tasks that interest him, work collaboratively with others, and approach problems with confidence.

That's the gift of growing up Montessori: not just academic preparation, but the development of a whole human being who's ready to take on the world with confidence, compassion, and joy.

    content: `A Seed Planted with Purpose

In a modest apartment in Sydney, Australia, surrounded by handwritten notes and books on education, Montessori teacher, Montessori Australia Ambassador, author, TEDx speaker, and co-founder of Upschool, Gavin McCormack, sat down with one goal: to create a course that would help children feel their power to change the world.

The result was The Wonderful World of Trees — a free, globally accessible education program designed to connect children with the natural world, empower them to take meaningful local action and, ultimately, help plant forests in countries across the planet through a partnership with global tree-planting initiative, Evertreen.

The result was The Wonderful World of Trees — a free, globally accessible education program designed to connect children with the natural world, empower them to take meaningful local action and, ultimately, help plant forests in countries across the planet through a partnership with global tree-planting initiative, Evertreen.

The concept was disarmingly simple: inspire children to learn about trees, care for one locally, and then make a real-world impact by planting a forest somewhere they may never visit, for people they may never meet.

The Urgency of Now

In a world facing climate breakdown, deforestation, and environmental collapse, The Wonderful World of Trees arrives as more than a learning module; it’s a response.

This course doesn’t sugar-coat the truth. Instead, it empowers children with knowledge, agency, and hope. They are not passive bystanders. They are active participants in healing the Earth.

According to the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization, the world loses approximately 10 million hectares of forest each year. That’s the equivalent of 30 football fields per minute. As fires blaze, biodiversity shrinks, and weather systems shift, the next generation is growing up surrounded by environmental uncertainty.

This course doesn’t sugar-coat the truth. Instead, it empowers children with knowledge, agency, and hope. They are not passive bystanders. They are active participants in healing the Earth.

Teaching Through Action

The Wonderful World of Trees is built on a simple truth: when children engage in purposeful work, learning becomes unforgettable.

In the first stage of the course, students are invited to observe and care for a single tree in their community: to name it; study it; draw it; and document its life. In doing so, they begin to understand trees not just as part of the landscape but as living companions and intelligent contributors to the planet’s survival.

Once they’ve built that relationship, students hold a vote to decide where they want their forest to grow. With over 30 countries to choose from ( including Mozambique, Nepal, the Philippines, Canada, Madagascar, and Brazil) their decision becomes a global connection. Evertreen then plants the forest on the school’s behalf and sends back a custom video of the planting.

One child put it best when they exclaimed, “I can’t believe we planted a forest in another country!”

The Movement Begins

Among the first to join this initiative was Ryan International Schools, one of India’s leading educational networks. Under the guidance of Dr. Snehal Pinto, Ryan Schools committed to using the course not only to educate, but to mobilize their students into one of the most impactful forest-planting campaigns ever initiated by a school network.

“I’m grateful to be a part of the vision that empowers our students to serve the planet, enabling them to learn for life.” – Dr. Pinto

Delhi International School, Dwarka, led by Anubha Srivastava and Muskaan Mehta, quickly followed. Their students have already begun creating a legacy: writing reflections; designing artwork; and taking part in forest planning across continents.

These schools aren’t alone. From Costa Rica to Rwanda, teachers and students are proving that meaningful action can start with a lesson and end with a living, breathing forest.

As McCormack explains, “When a child plants a tree for someone they’ll never meet, they learn that kindness doesn’t need applause. That’s where true education begins.”

Where Will You Plant Yours?

Thanks to the partnership with Evertreen, every school enrolled in the course can vote on where they’d like to plant their forest. The course invites schools to choose locations where reforestation is needed most, allowing them to discuss global challenges while making a tangible difference.

The map serves as both a lesson and a symbol, reminding students that education has the power to extend far beyond the classroom walls, across oceans and into communities they may never visit, but will have touched forever.

A Curriculum That Lasts a Lifetime

What sets this course apart is not just its message, but its method. Designed to be cross-curricular, it weaves through science, literacy, geography, environmental studies, and the arts. Children write stories and poems, analize environmental challenges, and explore how ecosystems work together in harmony.

Backed by research into how purpose-driven learning impacts long-term memory and emotional development, the course also taps into neuroscience. When children take meaningful action, their brains form stronger, more lasting connections, making this both a cognitive and emotional journey.

A Mission Rooted in Belief

At the heart of this movement is a single, unwavering belief: Every child deserves to feel their true potential to change the world.

Gavin McCormack and the team at Upschool created The Wonderful World of Trees not just to teach children about deforestation or environmental science, but to help them become connected, compassionate, and courageous. The result? A course that doesn’t just inform — it transforms.

Join the Global Movement

This is not a call for passive learning. It’s a call for schools to take part in something living, breathing, and urgent.

The course is completely free. It comes with a six-week lesson plan, video content, creative assignments, and a direct link to global forest planting. It’s ready to use, right now.

Because when children believe they can change the world — they usually do.

WE ARE NEW TO THE MONTESSORI PHILOSOPHY AND WANT TO MAKE THE MOST OF IT IN OUR FAMILY AND OUR CHILDREN’S LIVES. WE HAVE COME TO THIS A BIT LATE, AS WE JUST MOVED TO AN AREA WITH A MONTESSORI SCHOOL. WE HAVE ENROLLED BOTH OF OUR CHILDREN AND ARE TRYING TO LEARN AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. WHAT ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS WE SHOULD BE DOING AT HOME TO SUPPORT THE TYPE OF LEARNING THE CHILDREN ARE DOING AT SCHOOL?

- Just Beginning

Dear Parents,

You are asking all the right questions and doing all the right things! Montessori is indeed a philosophy, and you can’t adopt it too late in the life of your family or your child’s life. In a Montessori school, the guides believe that your child will reveal themselves through the work they choose and show us, the adults in their life, what they need to learn at that time.

It is our job to support him on this journey, introducing him to skills and activities that interest him, challenge him, and foster the development of his academic, social, and motor skills as he progresses along this path. We strive to allow him as much freedom as he can handle in doing things for himself and being independent. We create an environment with maximum accessibility based on the ages and skills of the children, and then teach them to use the materials in that environment safely. An Infant/Toddler environment would allow children to reach their own diapers and lunch boxes, so they can show us when they are hungry. A 3-6-year-old environment might contain scissors, a stapler, a tape dispenser, sewing needles, etc. An Elementary environment is much richer with all the tools and resources a child would need to plan a complicated individual or group project or a “going out” field trip of their choosing and planning, such as phones and internet accessibility.

 

The primary ways that your family can help are to allow your child to be as independent as possible in all areas of his life. Let your child do as much for himself as his age and skill set allow in the areas of dressing, eating, food preparation, and contributing to his family. Let him choose his clothing and dress himself as much as he is able. If he cannot do all of a dressing task, let him do the part that he can. If he is not strong enough to pull on his whole sock, you can pull the sock over his heel, and he can pull it up to his ankle. If he cannot manage his shirt, let him place his hands in the sleeve holes and then help him get his head into the head hole. Together, pull the shirt over his torso. Removing clothes is an easier skill and will be mastered more quickly. With that comes the responsibility of placing the dirty clothes into the dirty clothes hamper. Sure, you can do it quicker, but letting him do it aids him in the path to independence! As he gets older, invite him to help you sort the laundry, match the clean socks, fold the dish; practice in making choices about what to eat and how often to eat from these limited choices. If your refrigerator allows it, place a small pitcher and glass on a low shelf so your child can pour his own water or juice when he is thirsty. Your child can carry his own lunch box to the car and into school. Try to constantly think of things that you are doing that your child might be able to do for himself.

 

Strive for independence in eating and food preparation. At meal time, encourage your child to help prepare the meal. Teach your child to set the table. Perhaps at first, he will only place the napkins under the fork. But eventually, he will know where all the parts of the table setting go and will be able to do it independently. This is a great way to get some quality family time while teaching valuable table setting and food preparation skills. A child as young as two can tear lettuce, and a three or four can cut vegetables using a child-friendly knife (www. forsmallhands.com/small-nylon-knife).

Preschoolers can also help to cut vegetables or fruit, even when they are not brave enough to eat them. Once the meal is on the table, encourage your child to serve himself from the family serving bowls. This is good practice in motor control as well as choosing the amount of food you are planning to eat. If your child is elementary-aged and your family is ordering “take out,” allow your child to help in the planning and even in making the phone call to order the food. Your child can bring in the mail, feed the dog, empty the trash cans in the house, or take out the garbage. Families can work together to plan vacations, solve family problems, or create a new project, such as a vegetable garden or a fire pit. All of these things help the family function as a unit and help children realize that they are part of a group.

 

As he moves towards Kindergarten, he is probably ready to take over parts of packing his own school lunch. Try to arrange your refrigerator so that the things that your child will need for his lunch are available for him to access independently. He can select his own yogurt, or make his own sandwich, put his own fruit into the reusable container (and close it), and fill his own water bottle. Let it be a joint effort until his skills are solid, and then let that be your child’s work, and he has mastered another piece of independence. Let your child be a part of choosing what food to buy each week so he gets experience being a smart consumer, buying appropriate types and quantities of food at the grocery store. Once he is old enough, he will be able to contribute to the family grocery list and eventually shop for himself with confidence and skill.

 

Optimal development is the goal of every Montessori classroom and every family. Guides encourage each child to grow in their social, emotional, academic, selfhelp, and motor skills, each on their timetable. All the adults in a child’s life help him along his path to independence, and by working together, parents and Montessori schools aid the optimal development of a child so he can become his most authentic, happy, and healthy self.

    content: `Building Independence Through Daily Routines

Montessori education, every experience—no matter how small—is an opportunity to build independence, responsibility, and confidence. That includes the daily tasks we might otherwise rush through, like getting dressed, preparing a lunchbox, or packing a backpack.

At first glance, these routines might seem trivial compared to academic lessons. But in Montessori, they are seen as essential parts of a child’s development. When children are encouraged to take ownership of these everyday responsibilities, they gain more than just practical skills— they develop habits of self-reliance that shape how they approach learning, relationships, and life itself.

The Power of Practical Life

Montessori classrooms include an entire area dedicated to Practical Life activities, such as pouring, cutting, cleaning, and food preparation. These activities help children develop:

• Coordination: Fine-motor skills that support writing and other academic tasks.

• Order and Sequencing: Understanding steps in a process—from washing hands before a meal to organizing materials for a project.

• Concentration: The ability to focus deeply on purposeful tasks.

• Independence: A growing sense of “I can do it myself!” that spills over into all areas of life.

When children practice these skills at home—through dressing themselves, packing their lunch, or helping with meal prep—they reinforce the same capacities nurtured in the classroom.

Packing the Lunchbox: A Lesson in Choice and Responsibility

Instead of quickly packing your child’s lunch for them, consider inviting your child to help—or even take the lead. For younger children, this might mean choosing from a set of options you provide (Would you like apple slices or grapes today?). Older children can help assemble sandwiches, portion snacks, and even plan the menu for the week.

Through packing their own lunch, children learn:

• Planning: Deciding what to include requires thinking ahead.

• Nutrition: They start to understand what makes a balanced meal.

• Self-Care: Choosing foods they enjoy encourages mindfulness about what nourishes their bodies.

• Pride in Preparation: When a child eats a lunch they helped prepare, it often tastes better simply because they had a hand in making it.

Dressing for Success: More Than Just Clothes

Getting dressed might seem like a small task, but for a child, it’s a big step toward autonomy. Montessori teachers encourage children to dress themselves from an early age, using clothing that’s easy to manage, like elastic waistbands, large buttons, and simple fasteners.

At home, giving your child time to dress themselves each morning sends a powerful message: I believe in your ability to care for yourself.

This simple routine helps children develop:

• Fine-motor skills (zipping, buttoning, tying),

• Decision-making skills (choosing weather-appropriate clothing),

• Time awareness (getting ready within a timeframe),

• Confidence and competence. It may take longer at first—and it can be tempting to jump in when the clock is ticking—but that extra time is an investment in your child’s growing self-sufficiency.

Building a little bit of extra time into the activity decreases tension on both sides.

Small Tasks, Big Life Skills

Each of these daily routines—dressing, packing lunch, getting out the door on time—builds layers of important life skills:

• Sequencing: Understanding the order in which things need to happen.

• Personal Responsibility: Knowing they are capable of managing their own needs.

• Problem-Solving: Figuring out how to open tricky lunch containers or adapt to a forgotten item.

• Self-Confidence: Feeling proud of their ability to care for themselves.

And perhaps most importantly, these routines build executive function—the mental skills that help us plan, focus attention, remember instructions, and juggle multiple tasks. These are critical for success not only in school but throughout life.

How Parents Can Support Independence at Home

• Create a Child-Friendly Setup: Use low hooks, step stools, and accessible shelves so your child can reach their clothes, lunch supplies, and backpack.

• Allow Time: Start the morning a bit earlier to give your child time to complete tasks without rushing.

• Offer Choices: Guide your child by offering limited, appropriate choices (e.g., “Would you like the blue shirt or the red one?”).

• Be Patient: Mastery takes time and repetition. Focus on progress, not perfection.

• Model and Teach: Show your child how to do a task, then step back and let them try.

Independence: A Gift That Lasts

When we slow down and invite children to participate in daily routines, we’re not just saving a few minutes for ourselves—we’re empowering them for life. These small, everyday tasks build the mindset and abilities that help

Montessori children become capable, thoughtful, and self-directed learners.

So the next time your child zips up their jacket or carefully places their sandwich in their lunchbox, know that they’re not just getting ready for the day—they’re preparing for life. `,

    content: `Creating Simple Spaces for Growth

 

When visitors step into a Montessori classroom for the first time, they’re often struck by its beauty, calm, and sense of order. The environment feels inviting, child-centered, and purposeful. Children move confidently, choosing their work, returning materials neatly to their places, and engaging with others in peaceful collaboration.

Naturally, many parents wonder: How can we bring some of that magic into our home?

Fortunately, you don’t need to replicate a Montessori classroom to make Montessori work at home. By creating simple, intentional spaces that foster independence and choice within clear boundaries, you can nurture your child’s growth in confidence, curiosity, and responsibility right where you live.

The Prepared Home: More Than Furniture

In Montessori, the environment is considered the “third teacher,” alongside the adult and the materials. But creating a Montessori-inspired home is not about buying specialized furniture or expensive educational tools. Instead, it’s about preparing your home in ways that align with how children naturally learn and develop.

At its heart, a Montessori-inspired home environment:

• Encourages independence and self-care.

• Respects your child’s pace of learning and natural interests.

• Builds a sense of order and predictability.

• Promotes collaboration and peaceful interactions.

These qualities can be cultivated in any home, regardless of size, style, or budget.

Start Small: Setting Up Spaces for Independence

Rather than overhauling your entire home, begin by preparing just one space where your child can act independently, make choices, and contribute to family life.

The Entryway:

Make arrivals and departures easier by setting up a small bench where your child can sit to put on shoes. Add low hooks for coats and backpacks, and a basket for shoes or hats. When a child can manage their own belongings, it fosters a sense of personal responsibility.

The Kitchen:

Invite your child to participate in preparing food by providing access to a low shelf, stocked with their own utensils, cups, and plates. A child-sized water dispenser or pitcher allows them to pour their own drinks. Keep simple snacks within reach, empowering them to serve themselves. A learning tower or sturdy stool lets them safely help with washing vegetables, stirring, or baking.

The Bathroom:

With a low stool, your child can reach the sink to brush their teeth or wash their hands. Store towels, washcloths, and grooming items at their level to encourage independent self-care.

The Bedroom:

Create a calm, uncluttered space where your child can dress themselves. An open wardrobe or a low shelf with limited clothing options lets them make decisions without feeling overwhelmed. A small bookshelf with a curated selection of books fosters a love of reading.

Living & Learning Spaces:

Provide low shelves with a few open-ended toys, puzzles, and art materials. Organize these items so each has its place. Fewer choices displayed at a time help children focus deeply and complete activities before moving on to the next.

The Power of Simplicity and Order

Children thrive in environments where there is order and clarity. In a Montessori home, this means everything has a place, and children are involved in maintaining that order. Instead of being told to “clean up your room,” children are shown where things go, why it’s important, and are given the time to do it themselves.

This predictability helps children build not only Practical Life skills but also internal discipline and a sense of accomplishment.

Using Real, Purposeful Tools

Montessori encourages using real tools rather than toy imitations. Children can learn to care for their home with child-sized but functional tools—small brooms, dustpans, kitchen utensils, and gardening tools. Using real tools teaches them that their contributions are meaningful and valued.

Freedom Within Limits

A Montessori home is not a free-for-all; it is structured to provide freedom within clear, consistent boundaries. Children can make choices, but those choices are framed by safety, respect, and shared family values. For example, children might choose their own clothing from a set of weather-appropriate options, or decide which snack to eat from a selection you’ve prepared.

Observe and Adapt

As your child grows, their needs and interests will change. The Montessori approach emphasizes careful observation—watching how your child uses a space or material and making adjustments accordingly. If a shelf is being emptied but nothing is being engaged with, it might be time to rotate the materials or simplify the choices.

Creating a Calm Atmosphere

Montessori classrooms feel peaceful because they are designed to minimize chaos and overstimulation. At home, this might mean reducing clutter, using natural materials, and keeping decor calm, rather than bright and busy. Soft lighting, neutral tones, and quiet background music can contribute to an atmosphere of focus and peace.

Making Montessori a Way of Life

Setting up Montessori-inspired spaces is just the beginning. The deeper work is in creating a home culture based on respect, collaboration, and curiosity. This means:

• Speaking to your child with kindness and patience.

• Involving them in everyday life—cooking, cleaning, gardening.

• Encouraging effort rather than praising outcomes.

• Allowing mistakes as opportunities to learn.

• Holding family meetings where even young children have a voice.

Over time, these practices build not just a home that is tidy and organized, but a family culture that is cooperative, respectful, and joyful.

The Real Reward

When children are trusted with real responsibilities, they rise to the occasion. A Montessori home nurtures a child’s innate desire to contribute, to learn, and to grow—not because they are forced but because they feel respected, capable, and connected.

In the end, preparing the environment is really about preparing the child for life, and preparing ourselves, as parents, to see and support their remarkable potential.`,

In today’s world, screens are everywhere—smartphones, tablets, televisions, laptops—filling our homes, workplaces, and even classrooms. For parents trying to raise children in alignment with Montessori principles, navigating this reality can feel overwhelming. How much screen time is too much? Is any screen time appropriate for young children? And most importantly, what would Maria Montessori think about the role of technology in a child’s development?

While Dr. Montessori lived long before the digital age, her observations about child development remain remarkably relevant. If she were with us today, I believe she would encourage us to ask: Does this technology serve the child’s development? Does it help them grow in independence, curiosity, confidence, and self-awareness? With those questions in mind, let’s explore what Montessori suggests about technology use at home.

The Montessori Perspective: Hands Before Screens

At the heart of Montessori education is the understanding that young children (especially those under six) learn best through direct, hands-on engagement with the real world. Movement, the manipulation of physical materials, and rich sensory experiences are essential for brain development in these formative years.

By contrast, screens offer a two-dimensional experience that tends to be passive. Whether it’s a video, a digital game, or even an educational app, the experience often lacks the tactile feedback, movement, and deep concentration that Montessori materials provide. That’s why we suggest that for infants, toddlers, and very young children, screen time should be minimal or avoided entirely in favor of real-life experiences.

Dr. Montessori described the “absorbent mind” as the young child’s extraordinary ability to learn simply by interacting with their environment. To flourish, this absorbent mind needs real things: to touch, taste, climb, build, carry, pour, and explore—not just to swipe, tap, or watch.

Why Real-World Engagement Matters

The first years of life are when children build foundational skills: understanding cause and effect; developing spatial awareness; mastering language; and learning how to interact socially. These developmental tasks are best supported by:

• Handling real objects (blocks, utensils, tools);

• Moving freely and with purpose (indoors and outdoors);

• Conversing with real people in their daily lives;

• Exploring nature: digging in the dirt, observing insects, feeling the wind; and

• Participating in practical life activities, such as cooking, cleaning, gardening.

• Time spent in front of screens can displace these crucial, real-world experiences. While some digital content may be educational in intention, it still can’t replace the development of fine-motor skills, emotional intelligence, and problem-solving abilities that come from active, hands-on learning.

What About Older Children?

As children grow, particularly after age six, their cognitive abilities mature, and they become more capable of abstract thinking and symbolic reasoning. At this stage, Montessori principles still prioritize concrete experiences, but technology can start to play a thoughtful, purposeful role in learning.

Older children might:

• Research topics that capture their curiosity.

• Create presentations, stories, or digital artwork.

• Use apps for music composition, coding, or design.

• Communicate with distant family and collaborate on group projects.

Even then, the Montessori guideline remains: Technology should be a tool for creation, inquiry, and connection, not passive consumption. The goal is for children to be producers of knowledge, not just consumers of entertainment.

Guiding Principles for Montessori Families on Technology

If you want to align your family’s technology use with Montessori principles, here are the core guidelines I recommend.

• Delay Introduction for Young Children: For those under the age of three, avoid screens entirely, except for the occasional family video call.

• Prioritize Hands-On Learning: Make sure each day includes unstructured play, movement, outdoor exploration, and practical tasks.

• Be Intentional: Select high-quality, developmentally appropriate content that encourages critical thinking or creativity. Avoid content that is loud, fast-paced, or reward-driven.

• Watch Together: When screens are used, join your child. Co-viewing makes the experience social, gives you the opportunity to ask questions, and deepens understanding.

• Model Balanced Behavior: Children learn from our example. Let them see you read, cook, create, and engage without screens.

• Set Consistent Limits: Establish clear boundaries around screen time, such as avoiding devices during meals, before bedtime, or in bedrooms.

• Encourage Creation Over Consumption: Opt for screen activities that let children create—whether that’s drawing, coding, making videos, or creating music.

A Montessori Vision for Technology

If Maria Montessori were alive today, I believe she’d remind us that technology is neither inherently good nor bad; it’s a tool. The question is always: How does this serve the child’s growth?

For young minds, there is no substitute for real experiences. But for older children, technology (used thoughtfully) can extend their ability to explore, create, and connect with the world. The key is balance, intentionality, and keeping the child’s development at the center of every decision.

In Montessori, our work is always to support the child’s unfolding—not by shielding them from the world, but by guiding them to engage with it wisely, with curiosity, and with joy.

    content: `by Maria Rodriguez

After more than twenty years as a Montessori guide, I’ve witnessed countless aha moments when parents finally understand why we structure our classrooms the way we do. Just last week, a parent asked me, “Why is my five-year-old in the same room as three-year-olds? Shouldn’t she be with kids her own age?”

It’s a fair question and one I love answering, because the three-year cycle is truly the heart of what makes Montessori education so powerful.

In my primary classroom, I watch the same children grow from tentative three-year-olds to confident six-year-olds who practically run the place. It’s not just about mixing ages; it’s about creating a living, breathing community, where each child has a role that evolves over time.

Take Maya, for example. When she first arrived as a shy three-year-old, she spent weeks observing before she even touched a material. Now, in her third year, she’s the one who notices when a new child needs help finding the bathroom or shows them how to roll a work mat properly. That transformation doesn’t happen overnight; it unfolds over three years of building trust, competence, and confidence.

I see this pattern repeat with every child:

» First-year children (ages 3-4) are like sponges, absorbing everything around them. They’re learning not just academic skills, but how to be part of a community. They watch the older children with wide eyes, unconsciously learning social graces and work habits.

» Second-year children (ages 4-5) find their stride. They know the routines, they’ve built relationships, and they’re ready to tackle more complex work. They start helping younger children naturally, not because I ask them to, but because they want to.

» Third-year children (ages 5-6) become the classroom leaders. They’ve internalized the peace table process, enabling them to resolve conflicts effectively, and they take genuine pride in mentoring younger friends. This is their capstone year, when everything they’ve learned comes together in remarkable ways.

Why This Structure Works So Well

The Gift of Time and Continuity: One of the most beautiful aspects of the three-year cycle is that I get to truly know each child. I observe their learning patterns, their interests, their challenges, and their growth spurts. By the third year, I know that Marcus learns best in the morning, that Sophia needs extra time to process new concepts, and that Ahmed is ready for advanced math work even though he’s only five.

This deep knowledge allows me to meet each child exactly where they are, not where a curriculum guide says they should be.

Learning without Artificial Limits: In traditional classrooms, children are often held back by grade-level expectations. In my Montessori environment, I’ve seen four-year-olds reading chapter books and six-year-olds just beginning to write their names; both scenarios are perfectly normal and celebrated.

Last year, I had a five-year-old who was fascinated by the decimal system. Instead of saying “that’s too advanced,” I introduced him to more complex math materials. Meanwhile, his age-mate was still perfecting her Practical Life skills, and that was exactly what she needed.

The Magic of Peer Teaching: Some of my most powerful teaching moments happen when I step back and let the children teach each other. When six-year-old Elena explains the Color Tablets to three-year-old Jordan, she’s not just being helpful; she’s reinforcing her understanding in a way that no worksheet ever could.

I’ve noticed that children often learn better from their peers than from adults. There’s something about the way a child explains a concept that resonates with another child’s understanding.

Building Real Leadership Skills: By their third year, children in my classroom aren’t just older; they’re genuinely responsible community members. They help resolve conflicts, they notice when someone needs support, and they take ownership of our classroom environment.

I remember watching six-year-old David comfort a crying three-year-old by getting him a tissue and sitting quietly beside him until he felt better. That kind of emotional intelligence and empathy develops through years of being part of a caring community.

When the Cycle Gets Interrupted

It breaks my heart a little when families leave before completing the three-year cycle. The third year is when children shine—when they get to be the “big kids” who have waited patiently for their turn to lead.

I’ve seen children who left after two years and came back to visit. They’re often wistful, saying things like, “I wish I could have been a helper like Sarah is now.” They sense they missed something important.

That said, children who join mid-cycle can still benefit enormously. They just need extra support to find their place in our established community.

What I Tell Parents

When parents worry about the multi-age classroom, I remind them that this is how learning happens in real life. In families, older siblings naturally help younger ones. In communities, people of all ages work together. Our classroom simply mirrors this natural dynamic.

I also encourage parents to trust the process, especially during those quieter developmental periods. Some years, your child might seem to plateau academically while they’re doing important social and emotional work. Other years, they’ll make dramatic leaps. Both are valuable and necessary.

If I could convince every parent of just one thing, it would be to stay for that crucial third year. This is when children experience what we call academic explosion, when reading, writing, and math concepts suddenly click in profound ways.

But more than that, it’s when children develop true confidence. They’ve mastered the environment, they know their place in the community, and they’re ready to take on bigger challenges. They leave my classroom not just academically prepared but emotionally and socially ready for whatever comes next.

My classroom is a living laboratory, where children discover not just academic concepts but how to be human beings in community with others. The three-year cycle gives them the time and space to develop at their own pace while contributing to something larger than themselves.

After all these years, I still get excited watching a timid three-year-old transform into a confident six-year-old leader. It’s a privilege to witness this growth, and it’s only possible because we honor the natural rhythm of child development through our three-year cycle.

The mixed-age classroom isn’t just a nice idea; it’s a carefully designed environment that allows children to experience themselves as learners, helpers, and leaders. And that, ultimately, is what prepares them not just for the next level of school, but for life itself.

    content: `Innovations & Timeless Traditions for 2025-2026

Every September brings a familiar energy to Montessori classrooms: new faces, new lessons, and new opportunities to explore the world. As the 2025-2026 school year begins, parents may wonder—what’s changing in Montessori education? The beauty of Montessori is its foundation of timeless principles, yet it also evolves to meet the needs of today’s children and families.

Here’s a look at what’s fresh and what remains steadfast in Montessori classrooms this year.

Timeless Traditions That Still Shine

At its core, Montessori remains true to the vision Maria Montessori shared over a century ago: an education designed to cultivate independence, concentration, respect, and a lifelong love of learning. Some things never change—and for good reason.

• The Prepared Environment: Classrooms are still meticulously organized, inviting, and scaled to the child’s size and perspective. This empowers children to navigate their space independently.

• The Three-Year Cycle: Multiage classrooms continue to foster mentorship, leadership, and deep, individualized learning. Children progress at their own pace within a community that mirrors family life.

• Hands-On, Self-Correcting Materials: Montessori materials remain the gold standard for concrete, tactile learning. Whether it’s the Pink Tower in early childhood or Algebra Tiles in the upper levels, these tools translate abstract concepts into something a child can touch and explore.

• Grace and Courtesy: The social fabric of the classroom remains intentional. Children are still guided in respectful communication, empathy, and collaboration—skills as essential in life as reading or math.

 

 

 

Emerging Patterns

While the foundation remains strong, Montessori schools today are thoughtfully integrating new insights, tools, and strategies to keep the experience relevant and supportive.

by Montessori Foundation Staff

 

 

 

 

• Mindfulness and Well-Being Programs: Many Montessori schools are now embedding mindfulness practices into the daily routine—guided breathing, yoga stretches, or quiet reflection times help children develop emotional regulation in a fast-paced world.

• Enhanced Outdoor Classrooms: Outdoor learning spaces have expanded well beyond playgrounds. Schools are incorporating nature-based classrooms, gardening, and environmental stewardship activities that extend the Montessori curriculum into the natural world.

• Contemporary Cultural Studies: Montessori’s focus on geography, history, and culture now includes current global challenges. Topics like climate change, sustainability, and global citizenship are becoming integrated in ways that are age-appropriate and action-oriented. Typically, there is no political agenda. Montessori families represent a wide range of traditions and perspectives. The common theme is to honor the country in which we live, while learning about and celebrating the many cultures and traditions of the people who came to our country from the global community.

• Montessori and Technology—With Care: While Montessori remains cautious about screens for young children, thoughtfully curated digital tools are increasingly used with older students. Tools like digital microscopes, coding platforms, and collaborative research software enhance exploration in science and humanities without replacing hands-on learning.

• Inclusion: Many Montessori schools are deepening their commitment to inclusive education. This includes diversifying classroom materials and literature, celebrating a broader range of cultural traditions, and fostering conversations about equity, belonging, and respect.

The Montessori Continuum: Stronger Than Ever

Another exciting development is the growth of Montessori education beyond early childhood. More schools are offering Montessori programs for elementary, middle, and even high school students, giving families the option to continue this philosophy through adolescence. These programs incorporate more complex projects, entrepreneurship, and real-world experiences—all still grounded in Montessori’s developmental approach.

 

 

 

A Living Tradition

Montessori is often described as both an art and a science of education. Its enduring strength lies in the balance between preserving proven methods and embracing innovations that serve today’s learners. As you send your child off to school this fall, you can be confident that they are part of a living tradition—one that honors the child’s natural development while preparing them for the world they will inherit.

2025 Montessori-Inspired Trends for Parents

Montessori education doesn’t stop at the classroom door. Many parents want to bring elements of the Montessori approach into their homes, and new ideas are making it easier than ever. Here’s what’s trending with Montessori families this year:

• Home Organization for Independence: Parents are rethinking home spaces to help children do more for themselves—think low shelves, accessible kitchen tools, and self-serve snack stations. New modular furniture systems designed for Montessori homes are also gaining popularity.

• Mindful Tech Use: Families are adopting digital wellness practices— setting boundaries around screen time and using tech-free times for family connection. Some are introducing “tech sabbath” days on weekends to rest from screens altogether.

• Nature Play and Outdoor Learning: With the growth of outdoor classrooms, parents are creating home gardens, nature play areas, and even simple outdoor art spaces to encourage exploration and physical activity.

• Diverse Bookshelves: Parents are expanding their home libraries with children’s books that celebrate diverse cultures, perspectives, and stories— mirroring the inclusion that we tend to see in schools.

• Montessori Parenting Courses: A growing number of online courses and parent education groups help families learn how to apply Montessori principles in daily parenting, including positive discipline, fostering independence, and nurturing curiosity at home.

By embracing some of these trends, families can extend the benefits of Montessori education and help their children thrive in every environment.`,

    content: `By Joyce St. Giermaine

• Montessori is great for little children but that's it!

• Montessori is warm and fuzzy. Children enjoy it, but the real world isn't warm and fuzzy. They have to grow up sometime.

• I'm worried that Montessori shelters my child from life.

• Your children are still in Montessori. You should be thinking about their future. You do want them to go to college, don't you?

As a Montessori parent, you've probably heard many statements like those above, and you can probably add a few of your own. These remarks often are expressed by parents to other parents. Sometimes they come from well-meaning relatives, co-workers, neighbors, and just about anybody who knows you have a child in a Montessori school. When it comes to Montessori, it seems that everyone has an opinion.

When my children first started Montessori many years ago, I heard the statement "It takes courage to be a Montessori parent." I used to believe that it took courage because Montessori was an experimental program to which I was offering the use of my children as guinea pigs. As I became better informed, I quickly discovered this was not the case. Montessori has actually been around for over one hundred years and has been proven successful in many different educational environments throughout the world.

So what does it mean "It takes courage?" Maybe it's because Montessori tends to encourage children to think for themselves and articulate their own opinions. This is all wonderful, but as a parent, there are moments when it would be a whole lot easier to deal with a six-year-old who blindly and obediently accepts your explanation for why you don't want to create a recycling center right in the middle of your kitchen or a four-year-old who announces that she knows where hamburger really comes from and she's never going to eat it or any other animal ever again, period!

That must be it, I thought. It takes courage to live with these self-actualized, intelligent little creatures that have been encouraged by Montessori to think logically and express their opinions. I stuck with this understanding of the "courage" statement for a number of years. As a parent of two children who grew up in a Montessori school for ten years, I've got a million examples of a Montessori mother's courage in action, but that's the subject of another article.

As my children got older, I came to understand the courage statement in a whole different light. About the time that my children hit kindergarten, I found myself constantly defending my choice to keep my children in Montessori through the elementary years. The opinions of relatives were the most difficult and the hardest to discount because they came from people who were legitimately concerned about their grandchildren, or nieces and nephews. A case in point. My husband went to a New England boarding school, followed by Yale, followed by medical school at Columbia. He later topped it off by obtaining a law degree. Observing his grandson working with little beads while lying flat on his belly during a visit to the school, it was clear from the bemused expression on my father-in-law's face that Grampa Dan not only had doubts about Montessori, he also had doubts about us as parents.

The pressure can be enormous. There were many times when we were very tempted to walk away from Montessori and put our children into the capable hands of a more traditional school. After all, we turned out all right. Or did we?

Speaking only from my own personal experience, I question how we as a society have come to define "success." Is a child who grows up to become a doctor or a lawyer any more successful than a carpenter or a musician or a teacher or a homemaker? Do well-intended parents unconsciously push their children into status careers that send out all the right messages that we as a society have come to accept as the true measure of success.

Does it matter to us that our child grows up to be happy with her choice in careers, that she has a sense of fulfillment every day that she goes to work, that she approaches each day of her adult life with the same enthusiasm and eagerness to grow that she experienced as a child in the Montessori classroom, that she is able to accept the challenges that life has to offer and has the ability to adapt to new ideas and technology, that she understands that whatever gifts of intelligence and ability she possesses they are truly gifts and that others have other abilities and gifts that are different from her own? If we as parents can answer yes to these questions, then I believe our children are well placed in a Montessori environment for as long as we are able to keep them there.

In designing the cover, we tried to find a provocative, and indeed a shocking way, to visually portray the question: Does Montessori prepare children for the real world? The cover has a great deal of personal significance to me for three reasons. First, the boy in the picture is my son. I can assure you he does not look like that in real life (see insert). Second, it is the first and possibly only time I have ever succeeded in getting him into a tie and jacket long enough to have a picture taken (my mother will be so happy). Third, and most importantly, as a young adult, I chose a career in law for all the wrong reasons.

I believed that becoming a lawyer would give me prestige and wealth. What it gave me that I hadn't counted on was an ulcer and the nagging feeling that I should be doing something else with my life. Please don't get me wrong. I don't dislike lawyers (or tasseled loafers) -- even trial lawyers are ok with me as long as I don't have to join them in the courtroom. There is nothing wrong with the law, medicine, teaching, carpentry, or anything else as long as it is what is right for the individual.

If the answer to the question of whether or not Montessori prepares children for the real world is to be judged by whether or not great percentages of Montessori students will go on to a professional career, then the answer is maybe. If the answer to the question is to be judged by whether or not Montessori prepares children for life, the answer is an unequivocal yes.

As a parent, I have very high expectations for my children from Montessori. I expect them to be well prepared academically so that they will be able to follow their dreams wherever that may take them, but I hope that they will be able to continue making the responsible choices I see them make every day in their classrooms, I hope that they will be able to retain the love of learning and creativity that hasn't been driven out of them by a system that is so intent upon conformity that it places individuality at grave risk.

I care about academics, but I know that my children will get them from any good school, Montessori or otherwise. For me, the true value of Montessori goes beyond academics. When I look at my own children, I see behavior patterns that are different from my own at their age. I feel very comfortable that Montessori prepares children for the real world. In an interview, David Kahn once remarked, "Montessori is the real world. It's the dichotomy that's false." When you think about it, there's a lot of sense behind that statement.

I often wish I could have had a Montessori experience as a child. Things might have turned out differently. For one thing, I could have saved all that money on law school, but then I really do believe that all learning experiences have value. Maybe a bit of Montessori did rub off on me after all. At the age of 35, I quit the practice of law and I'm now doing something I find much more fulfilling, something I probably should have done in the beginning if I had not tried so hard to jam my round-pegged personality into a square professional hole.

When I announced that I wasn't going to practice law anymore, the initial overwhelming response was, "What do you mean you're not going to practice law anymore. How do you think you're going to survive in the real world without a profession?" Sound familiar?

More than anything, I hope that we as parents will have the courage to recognize and continue to support the human values and life lessons that our children are learning in their Montessori classrooms every day. As for my children growing up to pursue some kind of yuppie career, that's ok as long as it's right for them. Our world could probably use a lot more Montessori lawyers, politicians, and doctors who understand that there's more to life than being book smart. Above all, though, I think that as parents and educators we must never accept the premise that our objective must be to teach children to survive life. Better we should help them learn to celebrate it!`,

    content: `Many parents ask, “I can’t do it all—what should I never skip?” It’s a question that comes from a very real place. Life with young children is full, messy, and unpredictable. Between work, meals, laundry, and the emotional rollercoaster of toddlerhood, even the most well-intentioned parents can feel overwhelmed. Montessori may sound ideal in theory—but how do you begin when you’re just trying to get everyone dressed and out the door?

If you can only do one thing Montessori, let it be this: protect your child’s independence. More than any shelf, material, or routine, it is the child’s growing sense of self-agency that defines the heart of Montessori.

That means stepping back, even when it’s hard. It means letting your child struggle a bit—not in frustration, but in effort. It’s holding back the instinct to swoop in and fix, and instead allowing them to discover that they can do hard things. When a child senses that you trust them to do for themselves, something powerful takes root. They begin to believe in their own ability.

Consider the simple act of getting dressed. A two-year-old trying to put on socks may fumble, get them inside out, or put them on the wrong feet. It would be so much faster to just do it for them. But those few extra minutes of patience are an investment. Over time, the child not only learns the mechanics of dressing—they build confidence. They begin to see themselves as capable.

Or imagine the morning rush before school. You’re trying to get breakfast on the table and lunches packed. Your child wants to help pour their own cereal. You’re tempted to say no—it might spill, it will take longer. But this is where independence is born. Instead of brushing it off, you bring out a small pitcher with milk and a child-sized bowl. You stand close, just in case, but you let them pour. If it spills, you clean it up together. And then you see it—that proud little smile that says, “I did it.”

These aren’t just conveniences or chores. These are moments of trust, of growth, and of identity. The child isn’t helping—they’re participating. They are learning that they matter, that they are part of the family, and that they have the power to contribute.

Montessori reminds us that true independence is not just about doing things on your own—it’s about developing the executive function skills that make that possible. When children are allowed to choose their clothes, prepare a snack, or water the plants, they’re practicing planning, focus, self-control, and problem-solving. These skills form the foundation not only for academic success but for life.

Independence also transforms the parent-child relationship. Instead of being locked in constant correction, you become a guide and a partner. You begin to notice more. You step back, observe, and let your child lead. And in doing so, you create space for connection that isn’t based on control, but on mutual respect.

This approach doesn’t require special tools or a perfect home environment. It starts with noticing your child’s desire to do things for themselves—and saying yes more often. Yes, you may carry your plate to the sink. Yes, you may put your shoes on, even if they’re on the wrong feet. Yes, you may help stir the pancake batter, even if it’s a bit messy.

Every time you say yes, you’re saying something deeper: I see you. I trust you. You are capable.

This isn’t about letting children run wild or do whatever they want. Montessori is built on the idea of freedom within limits. We prepare the environment, set clear expectations, and then step back. We create spaces that invite independe nce and make it safe to explore. We hold boundaries with kindness, and we support children without rescuing them.

So if your days feel rushed, if you’re not sure where to start with Montessori, start here. Create a little time and space for your child to try things on their own. Resist the urge to jump in. Celebrate effort over perfection. And above all, let your child know—again and again—that you believe in their capabilities.

Because when a child knows they are trusted, they begin to trust themselves. And that, more than anything else, is what Montessori is all about.`,

Is your child ready to use the potty or toilet?

With summer around the corner, I’m getting more questions in class about toilet training and if I have any Montessori tips. So today, here is the approach I prefer when your child is showing interest in using the toilet.

“Learning to use the toilet is a natural process that begins when your child’s desire to be grown up and his neurological development have reached the point where he can control his bladder and bowels. We don’t train children to use the toilet, we support them when they are ready.”

(How to Raise an Amazing Child: The Montessori way to bring up caring confident children, by Tim Seldin)

A Natural, Gradual Process

Using the toilet is a very natural and gradual process that develops at the child’s pace, rather than when the parent decides the child is going to be toilet trained.

We can begin very naturally when the child is young, talking with them about their bodily functions as we change their nappy. It is a normal process, and we can explain that everyone uses the toilet to get rid of the parts of food that our body does not need. It is also a good idea not to give them a negative feeling towards these bodily functions, for example, by making faces when changing their nappy.

A potty can be available from a young age so the child can sit on it and imitate others in the household, even before they have bladder and bowel control.

Children often begin to be interested in toilets around one year old. Around this age, the child develops the physical ability to control their bladder and bowel, but mostly they just want to flush the toilet or play with the water. The child can be redirected to a more appropriate place for playing with water, such as the bathroom sink.

Then, when the child becomes interested in dressing and undressing themselves, we can choose clothing that they can manage themselves, so that they can learn to pull their own trousers up and down. Elastic-waisted trousers can be very useful at this time! As disposable nappies are so good at keeping a child dry these days, it can also be nice for your child to wear underpants or training pants around the house as much as possible, so that the child feels the difference between wet and dry. They begin to learn that it feels nicer to be dry and begin to hold their bladder for longer periods.

After this very gradual preparation, and when the child is showing more interest in sitting on the toilet or potty, you can slowly teach them how to pull down their pants, sit on the toilet/potty, use toilet paper, pull up their pants, flush the toilet, and wash their hands.

Give Independence

Once children show interest in using the toilet/potty, the bathroom can be set up to give them as much independence as possible.

If using a potty, it is a good idea to keep it in the bathroom rather than moving it around the house. That way, your child can always find it. The bathroom is also a good place to have a pile of cloths for cleaning, a bucket for wet clothing, and a supply of clean underpants. The child can help by getting some dry underpants and putting any wet pants in the bucket. When a child is involved in the process, the child (not the adult) has ownership of the process.

 

 

The Adult’s Role

“There should be no pressure, no reward or punishment, no adult deciding when the child should learn to use the potty. The environment is prepared, and the child is free to explore and imitate in these natural developmental stages.” (Susan Stephenson, The Joyful Child)

It is best for the parent to support the child but not become emotionally involved. Here are some ideas to assist the child in the process of learning to use the toilet:

• Find ways to make the child feel confident. For example, provide a small stool for their feet when using the toilet.

• Incorporate toileting into the child’s routine. Offer the potty/toilet at times when the child normally pees, for example: upon waking; before going outside; after coming in from outside; after lunch/before nap; etc.

• Say, “It’s time to use the toilet” rather than “Do you want to go to the toilet?” (the answer will probably be no) or say, “I think you need to go to the toilet” (the adult becomes involved). As children become more aware of their bodies, they will be able to tell you, “No, I don’t need to go.” You can then say something like, “Of course, I know you will tell me if you need any help when you need to go.” You can also use an alarm clock set at regular intervals to remind them to go, “The clock says it’s time to use the toilet.”

• Never force a child to use the toilet or potty.

• Never scold or over-congratulate—going to the toilet is the most normal thing to do and we should keep it in its proper place, for example, avoid clapping and celebrating

• Do not interrupt children to use the toilet—for example, wait until they have finished their puzzle, etc. before offering the potty.

 

 

When they don’t make it in time…

If a child becomes wet, stay calm and be reassuring. Do not make them feel ashamed. You may wish to say, “I see you are wet. Let’s go get some dry clothes.” Your child can get them from the supply in the bathroom and even help wipe the floor and wash their hands. Let them change at their own pace, and give help if they ask for it or if they are overwhelmed.

If they have wet clothes but they are playing with a toy, you can wipe up around them and wait until they are finished before suggesting you get some dry clothes.

Some issues can cause a setback to toileting, for example, the birth of a younger sibling, a divorce, or some other upheaval in daily life. These potential problems tend to resolve themselves if the adult does not make a big deal about it.

Really, the most important tip is to follow your own child.

Sarah Martinez remembers sitting at her kitchen table three years ago, agonizing over whether to keep her daughter Emma in Montessori for kindergarten. The public school was right around the corner, and the choice seemed obvious at first. Yet something held her back from making that switch—an intuition that would later prove transformative for her daughter’s education.

Each year, thousands of parents face this same pivotal decision point in their children’s educational journey. When your child can attend the local public schools for free, why would anyone want to invest in another year’s tuition? While the answer may be connected to family finances, many families make their children’s education a top priority and see the choice of staying in Montessori as an essential investment in their children’s future.

Other families hope to have their children move to another highly regarded private school. They worry that if they don’t get in at the earliest age, these schools will begin accepting other children and they will never get a spot. They don’t realize that many well-known private schools focus their attention on the higher grades but offer programs for younger children to meet the demands of their existing families. Often, these early childhood programs are much less sophisticated than those provided by Montessori schools.

The key point to keep in mind is that everything comes together in the third year of the Montessori Children’s House program, the kindergarten year. This is a time when Montessori children blossom!

“Free public kindergarten versus another year of tuition; it felt like such an obvious decision at first,” reflects Michael Chen, whose son is now in fourth grade. “But when we really looked at what our son would be giving up by leaving Montessori, the calculation changed completely.”

Consistency matters deeply, especially in the first six years of life. When children transfer from Montessori to a traditional kindergarten, they face a dramatic shift in their learning environment. “The adjustment period alone took months,” shares Jennifer Blake, whose first child transferred to traditional kindergarten before she made a different choice for her younger children. “Looking back, we lost precious learning time just helping our daughter adapt to a completely different way of being in school.”

 

The contrast between Montessori and conventional kindergarten programs goes far beyond teaching methods. In traditional kindergarten settings, children must adjust to an environment where morning announcements interrupt the flow of learning; group instruction takes precedence over individual exploration; and teacher-directed activities replace self-directed learning. Most kindergartens have much lower expectations for five-year-olds than Montessori programs, which dramatically changes the course of their learning during this crucial year of their lives.

Maria Anderson, now a high school math teacher, saw this difference clearly when observing both systems. “In my son’s Montessori class, five-year-olds work with sophisticated mathematical concepts using concrete materials. Their understanding of the decimal system, place value, and mathematical operations becomes internalized through hands-on experience. When children leave before they’ve had time to fully absorb these concepts, that early learning often evaporates because it isn’t reinforced in traditional settings.”

Lisa Thompson witnessed this difference firsthand when her daughter Kate completed the three-year Montessori cycle before moving to a public school for first grade. “By the time Kate entered first grade, she had such a solid foundation in mathematics and language that she was able to help other students. But it wasn’t just about academic skills; she knew how to learn independently and wasn’t thrown off by new challenges.”

The research supporting the Montessori approach continues to grow. Educational psychologist Howard Gardner noted a concerning pattern in traditional education: “Many schools have fallen into a pattern of giving kids exercises and drills that result in their getting answers on tests that look like understanding. Most students, from as young as those in kindergarten to students in some of the finest colleges in America, do not understand what they’ve studied in the most basic sense of the term. They cannot take knowledge learned in one setting and apply it appropriately in a different setting.”

Montessori’s focus on teaching for understanding directly addresses this challenge. In a primary Montessori classroom, three- and four-year-olds benefit from two years of sensorial preparation for academic skills by working with concrete materials. This hands-on experience gradually allows the child to form mental pictures of abstract concepts. Parents and educators have often underestimated the value of these sensorial experiences. Yet, research consistently shows that young children learn by observing and manipulating their environment, not through textbooks and workbook exercises.

Robert Patel’s experience with his son Jake illustrated another crucial aspect of the kindergarten year: leadership development. “We almost pulled Jake out after his fourth year,” Robert admits. “But watching him become a classroom leader during his kindergarten year transformed him from a hesitant child into a confident learner. That confidence has stayed with him through middle school.”

Many parents worry that their five-year-old will spend the kindergarten year taking care of younger children instead of doing their own work. Emily Williams, whose daughter Rachel is now in college, laughs at this common concern. “What we discovered was that teaching younger children actually deepened Rachel’s understanding of the concepts she had learned. When she had to explain something to a younger child, it really cemented her own learning.”

Five-year-olds are typically the leaders and role models in the primary Montessori classroom. They help set the tone and serve as examples of appropriate behavior. They often help younger children with their work, teach lessons or correct errors. Most have been waiting the longest time to be one of the ‘big kids,’ and the experience of playing this leadership role does wonders to reinforce their sense of autonomy and self-confidence.

The kindergarten year is also a time of profound intellectual development. Five-year-olds are beginning to reflect upon the world in new ways. They pay closer attention, notice more details, ask more questions, and begin to explain the world in their own terms. It’s a crucial period of integration when children begin to synthesize everything they’ve learned in their first few years.

David Foster, whose daughter continued in Montessori through elementary school, saw this integration process firsthand. “During that kindergarten year, we watched in amazement as all the pieces started coming together. The careful preparation of the previous two years suddenly blossomed into this incredible period of growth and understanding.”

By the end of age five, Montessori students commonly develop advanced academic skills, but this isn’t our ultimate goal. Our real hope is that these children will feel good about themselves and enjoy learning. The key concept is readiness. In Montessori, if a child is not developmentally ready to advance to a new skill or level of understanding, they are neither left behind nor made to feel like a failure. Our goal is not to ensure that children develop at a predetermined rate but to ensure that whatever they do, they do well and feel good about themselves as learners.

“The decision to stay for kindergarten was really our first step in recognizing how powerful this approach to education could be,” reflects Jennifer Blake, whose children ultimately attended Montessori through eighth grade. “My children learned not just academic skills but how to think, how to solve problems, and how to be confident learners. That foundation has served them incredibly well throughout their education.”

When making this crucial decision for your child, remember that kindergarten is more than just another year of preschool. It’s the culmination of a carefully prepared cycle of learning that builds toward the moment when children consolidate their skills, embrace leadership roles, and integrate their understanding of the world around them. As countless families have discovered, the investment in that final year can yield returns that last a lifetime. 

“All other factors… sink into insignificance beside the importance of feeding the hungry intelligence and opening vast fields of knowledge to eager exploration.”— Maria Montessori, To Educate the Human Potential

What happens when children use books to learn?

Two seven-year-olds in a lower elementary Montessori class say they want to write a research paper about elephants. Great! Go ahead! They discuss with their teacher what to do first: Find information about elephants. Where? In books.

As you read how this process plays out, I think you’ll see why Forest Bluff School (Illinois)—as a true Montessori school—continues to deliver an education that doesn’t necessarily follow the latest trends. In essence, you’ll understand, “Why not just Google it?”

The two young girls begin their search on foot. There are some books around the school building, so they visit neighboring classrooms and various closets of books to look for sources that might discuss elephants. They are on a quest! They must think about what to look for, which categories, nonfiction versus storybooks . . . all this takes some thinking, some discerning. They are only seven years old, but they can already tell that a book about mammals might have information on elephants. They find a book about Africa. This seems promising, too. They collect the six relevant books they find and bring them back to their classroom. Then they sit with their pile and start looking through them and reading.

They find a page about elephants and rush off to get lined paper. They start writing facts down in their own words:

Elephants are 13 feet tall. Isn’t that amazing?

Elephants only eat plants. But they can eat wood!

They can weigh 15,000 pounds! Isn’t that amazing?

Elephant brains are bigger than human brains, but they are much smaller compared to their bodies than for humans. That is so interesting!

Elephants are the biggest animals on the earth, next to whales! Isn’t that amazing?

The teacher tries to keep the grin off her face when they show her their first sentences. This personalization of the research is so like these two girls, but she knows they will depart from this style as they learn more about objective reporting. For this early paper, she’ll let them include their reactions.

When the girls have exhausted the books in the building, they are not satisfied. There is so much more they want to know about elephants! Why do some have bigger tusks than others? How do people ride them? How old do they live to be? How many babies can they have? And on and on.

To find answers, they could go to the local public library with their parents after school, or their teacher may fetch some books for them the next day to keep their research going. If they were eight years old or older, they would walk to the town’s local library during the day and return with a pile (as is customary in this school). Students ages eight and older learn to use the library’s Dewey Decimal System to find books on their topic and search the aisles by numbers and letters to find the section with their topic. This requires an exercise in alphabetizing, too.

When they start using the library independently, Forest Bluff students get an idea of how information is logically organized through a physical experience. For example, elephants are in the animal section, and this would take these girls near books about other animals. The students would look through the books that focus on elephants to decide which ones would be helpful. Some will prove too cursory for their next layer of research, with just a few sentences on each page. One book may look hard to read, with very few pictures, but they might decide to check it out for the details they’re looking for and then add it to their growing pile. They’ll plan this walk to the library by estimating the time it takes to walk there and back and how long they’ll allow themselves to find books and check them out. They’ll need to sign out of the classroom with their teacher, sign in to the library with the librarians, out of the library, and then back into their school.

Can you see all the things that are happening here? How might this scene unfold differently if the girls simply Googled elephants on a computer?

If they had instead searched through a computer, someone—or something—else would have done all this thinking for them:

• Which information to interact with?

• Which answers are the right ones for the questions they have?

• What reading level should be presented to them (not knowing their abilities, their capacity to grow in these abilities through their motivation to comprehend the information)?

• Where the information fits in the broader context of the world and how to categorize the information.

Also consider all the physical movement involved in gathering information: walking through their school building, climbing up on a step stool to reach books in the closet, lifting and sliding books back into place in order to leave the closet organized for others, asking teachers in other rooms if they may borrow a book, eventually navigating the local public library, carrying the heavy books back from the library. How about the time this gives them to think while they do all this? To discuss what they want to find? To navigate, to search, to make decisions? To check their watches to make sure they’re back to the school building on time? To discover by experience roughly how long it takes to walk that distance between the library and the school.

So, so many things happen that just don’t happen when you Google information!

Is the Information Accurate? How Will They Know?

Googling may be faster, but online searches skip all the foundational building of a researcher. A student growing up without this foundation is missing out on doing things for themselves on so many levels. When students use computers instead of walking through these physical and mental steps, too much is being done for them.

It’s true that those books about elephants may have been a little outdated if they weren’t published in the last few years. Depending on the topic of study, some information changes monthly in our world today as new results are found. However, the process of learning how to research is the foundational step upon which all further success depends, and, therefore, it comes first. If a set of encyclopedias is several years old, it still serves its purpose for young children because it presents a reliable, accessible source of collected information that is categorized and logical, and almost every topic you can think of can be located. This is so exciting for curious young minds! A physical encyclopedia is just the right structure and speed to match their capacities and feed their inquisitive nature.

Over time, students develop their ability to discern between accurate information and outdated information by experiences with solid sources alongside their teachers and peers. At the completion of their six years in elementary and two additional years at the secondary level, they emerge as experienced, critical thinkers.

When children begin searching online before they are ready, sources of information can appear too similar for a child to recognize value differences. By contrast, with physical books and periodicals, children can pick up simple clues: the cartoonish pictures versus real photographs of elephants; the year the book was published; the references in the back; the mention of real scientists in the field studying elephants versus a story about an elephant with a name looking for his mommy. When our children see these things, they have the stepping stones to noticing more subtle differences in online searches when they are more experienced in adolescence.

Will They Understand the Internet?

As a side note, you may wonder if your children will be comfortable with the online world if they don’t experience it in grade school. Paula has a great example of watching a very “hands-on” learner—her own son—grow up at Forest Bluff without any technology until high school. The result? Her son became fascinated with computers in college and became a coder, a profession he loves. Like most Forest Bluff graduates, this young man goes on a search every time he wonders about something, which is several times a day. With his inquisitive mind that was nurtured and encouraged in Montessori, he finds “Great Courses” audio recordings on a variety of subjects, watches YouTube videos of various experts talking about their fields and reads tons and tons of books. His interests range from the history of obscure countries to neuroscience to astrophysics to international politics…almost anything! But Paula’s son is not unusual among Montessori graduates. When children hear, “You want to research elephants? Great! Go for it!” from the time they were six and seven at school, their curiosity and excitement about learning just grows and grows. Why not?

And by the way, when Paula asks her 22-year-old son at the dinner table, “How do you know all this incredible information?!” He sometimes answers, “Mom, I just Googled it.”

Sarah Robbins has been a teacher at Forest Bluff School for over 20 years: first as an Elementary teacher of 9-to-12-year-olds, then for 6-to-9-year-olds and finally for 12-to-15-year-olds in the Secondary Level. “My ten years of teaching at the Secondary Level was an inspiring experience for me intellectually and also experientially because of the three off-campus trips each year that were largely planned and carried out by the students themselves. We were often out camping and working in nature for up to two weeks at a time: an adventurous, challenging and tremendously rewarding experience. Today, I am thrilled to be working once again in the Elementary classroom with 6-to-9-year-olds for whom everything is so new and exciting. I love sharing in their joy and enthusiasm for their work and watching them develop strong moral character and the ability to collaborate in their work together.”`,

    content: `A Developmental Perspective

by Andrew Faulstich

Many adolescent parents find themselves wondering what happened to their once talkative and engaging child, who has suddenly become more distant and peer-focused in adolescence. This transformation is both natural and necessary, representing what Montessori described as a social and physical rebirth. This article explores why this shift occurs and provides practical guidance for parents on how to evolve their relationship with their adolescent positively. By learning to listen to their adolescents truly, parents can maintain a strong connection even as the nature of their relationship changes. The key is recognizing that, while your adolescents may seem to be pulling away, they need your support and acceptance more than ever as they navigate this critical period of identity formation.

Every year I have multiple caregivers ask me the same question: Where has my child gone?

The arc of these stories is strikingly similar. When their children were elementary-aged, they were talkative, curious about the world, and enjoyed being with their caregivers. At the end of the day, they ran out to the car and told their caregivers story after story about their day.

Then, in what seemed like an abrupt shift at age twelve, the conversation about the school day started and ended with one word: fine.

The elementary child is gone; replaced by an adolescent, who cares more about peers than school and seems like an entirely new person.

To parents, this abrupt shift in the caregiver-child relationship can be startling. However, it does not mean that your relationship with your adolescent is over. Rather, it must take a new form. To achieve this new relationship, caregivers must learn to listen to their adolescent in a new way. To listen to our adolescents, we must understand the massive developmental shifts that occur for them during this unique period in their lives.

Why is there such a sudden shift in personality when young people become adolescents?

Montessori described the adolescent plane, from twelve to eighteen years old, as a social and physical rebirth. The young person ceases to become a child, shedding their childhood body and identity, and must grow into their new adult bodies and identities.

The obvious changes are the physical ones: puberty brings new changes to the adolescent nearly every day. As they grow into their adult body, they don’t know what changes will occur next.

While we cannot see the social rebirth on the outside, the sudden change in relationship with parents is a manifestation of that inner change.

Adolescents are seeking social and economic independence as they begin to see their place in the adult world. They are asking three key questions about their identities: Who am I? What am I good at? What am I good for? In that search, they begin to look for role models outside the home. Whereas the elementary child looked up to their parents as “superheroes,” adolescents develop a critical lens to the adults around them as they scrutinize their actions to understand how they want to act as they become adults.

What is most surprising for adults is that early adolescence is a period with a decreased academic capacity. However, this is not because students literally lose the capacity to learn new things! It is because their focus is on constructing their new identities in the context of the social worlds around them. They need positive experiences in their peer group to practice the “selves” they will become, and the most potent of these experiences are typically non-academic. Adolescents are in a period of experimentation, seeking to understand the ways they fit in the world, which is why their relationship with their parents must change. They are transforming into a fundamentally new person and will need new ways to relate to their parents in the context of their new identities.

How to Listen and Observe Your Adolescent

Preparing Yourself to Fully Listen: Montessori wrote that if we provide a developmentally appropriate environment for adolescents, if we learn to truly listen to their needs and support the self-construction of their personalities, then noble characteristics would emerge. I have seen in my own experience with adolescents that they can be the most kind, thoughtful, introspective, and funny people I have ever met. Yet, we cannot “teach” them to be this way; we must prepare an environment for these qualities to emerge, and this environment begins at home.

We must remember that adolescents are looking to you, as caregivers, for models of how to act in the world. Adolescents begin to realize that many adults say they hold certain ethical convictions, and then they proceed to act in contrast to those values. Adolescents are particularly sensitive and critical of such hypocrisy. Knowing that our adolescents are always watching, we must examine ourselves as adults and caregivers: What are we modeling? When we interact with their peers, teachers, other family, and friends, are we ourselves being model citizens? Are we acting in a way that invites authentic and safe conversation from our adolescents?

If your adolescent is pulling away from family life, that means they require more meaningful citizenship in the home.

Connecting

Your

Adolescent to Adult-Like Responsi-

bility: To truly honor your adolescent, you must recognize that the process of development is messy and that they will make mistakes, but that doesn’t mean they’re not ready for meaningful, adult-like work. In fact, it is precisely through the process of trial and error that they form their personalities.

We must learn to listen to more than just their words, but also their actions. We know that adolescents are seeking to form their new identities in the context of the social worlds they inhabit, including the social world of your immediate family. If your adolescent is pulling away from family life, that means they require more meaningful citizenship in the home. What are real (not contrived or childish) responsibilities that your adolescent can take on which will help them toward independence and a meaningful contribution to family life? Offering such opportunities, as invitations, rather than commands, will allow your adolescent to find meaning in their family role and have a new means of relating to you.

Supporting your adolescent in finding a job is also a key developmental experience toward economic independence. One of my former students struggled academically due to learning differences she had. This initially led to a lack of confidence broadly, as she felt unable to keep up with her peers. That same year, she became old enough to be a lifeguard, and it was a key experience which changed her entire sense of self. For the first time, not only was her work important, but she was promoted to become an integral part of the pool management team. The confidence she gained through her experiences as a lifeguard transferred to her outlook in school: she was more confident, was more willing to take risks, and demonstrated confidence and poise.

Often, adolescents will not explicitly say that they are feeling uncertain, but we can read their inner feelings from the indirect communication they’re giving us. We can listen to those needs and be the dynamic link to those adult-like responsibilities that give them a new way to relate to us and the world. Central to this is offering choice and voice. We never want to superimpose needs on our adolescents. Rather, we provide options and should engage in conversation with them about what they want and need, recognizing that they are still in the process of discovering that for themselves!

Holding Your Judgment

Developmentally, adolescents are always concerned with what others will think of them. The metaphor is that they feel as though they are always “on stage,” being watched and judged by others. That means that when they muster the courage to have a difficult conversation with you, they are looking very closely at your reaction, for any hint of judgment or dismissal of their experiences. Often, the simplest reaction, such as a raised eyebrow or question (e.g., Is it really that bad?) could trigger your adolescent to think they’re not being fully heard.

Ultimately, what adolescents are looking for is the knowledge that you will continue to love and accept them no matter what happens. That doesn’t mean that you’re not allowed to have your own feelings about what they tell you or what they do. However, how you respond and express those feelings is key.

Difficult conversations are key moments to model care and honesty, and it’s always important to start by expressing care. You might enter the conversation by saying: “I’m so glad that you felt safe to bring this to me, and you know that no matter what happens, I care deeply about you.”

Depending on the topic, you may need to share your discomfort with what they bring up. “I’m feeling concerned because X” or “I am feeling like that might not be in your best interests to do Y. What else do you think could be a solution?” If you need to draw boundaries or set expectations, this is a key time to do so, while always doing so with the lens of care and upholding their independence, within the limits of health and safety.

Know that your new relationship is an ever-evolving journey

Your adolescent is going through new and unexpected changes every day. They are having new feelings and experiences that they could not have expected and don’t yet have the language to describe. Truly listening to your adolescent means that you must accept that as your relationship grows, and it may not be easy.

There will be times when, despite your best efforts to listen, your adolescent doesn’t have the language to tell you what’s going on. This may lead to arguments, discomfort, and frustration, but you should take heart in knowing that if you are willing to stay in it, to work toward your new relationship with your adolescent, no matter how difficult it may be, that it will blossom because of your deep listening and commitment.

    content: `As we head into our 46th year at Ghent Montessori School in Norfolk, Virginia, we look back and celebrate our incredible school community that is stronger than ever. We have supportive and committed families from many countries around the world who have come to GMS. We have an incredible staff with a shared vision. Our teachers have over 300 years of shared experience working with children, and our trained Montessori teachers have over 80 years of experience in Montessori education. We are inclusive and diverse, accepting children who have as many different learning styles and birth stories as there are children. We celebrate children as individuals and strive daily to meet their needs with joy and love. We are Ghent Montessori school, and we are proud of who we are!

Our History

Ghent Montessori School is the oldest Montessori School in the Hampton Roads (Virginia) area. GMS was founded by Sarah Frost in 1978 at First Lutheran Church in the Norfolk area of Ghent. In 1982, the first stage of our current building (610 Mowbray Arch) was built as part of the new community, Ghent Square. This location in downtown Norfolk, with the Chrysler Museum across the street on one side and the Harrison Opera House on the other, is crucial to the identity of the school today.

In 1994, Suzanne Pugin became Head of School and eventually purchased the school from Sarah and Larry Frost in 1996. In 2020, Ruland Gagne, a Hampton Roads native, took over as Head of School. She was a teacher in Lower and Upper Elementary at Ghent Montessori for 27 years. She holds an AMI Montessori degree, as well as a master’s degree in Early Childhood education. Ruland and Susan Colpitts together took over ownership in July 2021. Susan has a long history with the school; her husband, Norman, was an Upper Elementary teacher at the school, and they sent their three daughters to GMS in the early 2000s. Susan is currently the school’s business manager.

LOTS OF RENOVATING!

time, but we are not expanding. We are happy where we are and with this number of families. We will know them all and we take pride in this. Creating relationships and collaborating with our families to meet the needs of each child as an individual is important at GMS.

Embracing Transcience

The Hampton Roads area, which includes the Naval Station Norfolk, has one of the largest military populations in the world, with over 46,000 active-duty military. We embrace our military families, even though this can be seen as a challenge in a Montessori school, where we want families committed to Montessori for more than a few years. We believe that the children of our military families, who must move often, benefit from Montessori education. When so much in these children’s lives change with a move, it is nice for them to transfer to another Montessori school where their education will stay somewhat the same. We take the challenge and embrace it because it benefits these children.

Accreditation

Ghent Montessori has been accredited through the International Montessori Council (IMC) since 2015.

When Ruland took over as Head of School during the summer of Covid, she talked families of 75 children into staying. This 75 has grown in three years to 150 children with waitlists in most classes. In these three years, we have renovated the playground and the second floor to make room for another Lower Elementary classroom and a larger Upper Elementary. We also renovated our Toddler community, our Middle School, and the office. We also replaced windows, the roof, and all the flooring! This past summer, we added a top-notch security system. Currently, we have 150 children, 18 months through Middle School. We are committed to improving the school one year at a

International Montessori Council-accredited schools are committed to standards of exemplary integrity in their professional relationships with parents, students, faculty, and other Montessori schools. We have trained Montessori teachers (MACTE) in all our classes, and they are trained at the level they are teaching. We are proud of this accreditation and enjoy our relationship with IMC.

We love our school and welcome you to visit if you are ever in the Hampton Roads area. Come see us at GMS. 

Love in Action: Small Gestures with a Big Impact

As parents, it’s easy to assume that our children know we love them. After all, we provide for their needs, cheer them on from the sidelines, and remind them to brush their teeth and do their homework. But love, while it may seem obvious to us, isn’t always as apparent to children as we think. In fact, research has consistently shown that when children feel genuinely and openly loved, it creates a ripple effect, shaping their confidence, resilience, and overall well-being.

So, how can we ensure our children not only hear our love but feel it deeply? And why is this so crucial to their development? Let’s explore the science and the simple, meaningful ways parents can demonstrate love in ways that matter most.

Love as the Foundation for Lifelong Success

Numerous studies highlight the transformative power of love on a child’s development. Children raised in an environment rich in affection, are more likely to become resilient, self-assured, and emotionally healthy adults.

Resilience and Emotional Strength: A child who feels loved is better equipped to handle challenges. They see failures as temporary and are more willing to persevere through adversity. Love provides them with a psychological safety net to take risks and learn from mistakes.

Confidence and Self-Worth: Parental love reinforces a child’s belief in their own value. Knowing they are cherished gives them the courage to explore the world, form meaningful relationships, and pursue their goals.

Mental and Physical Health: Love also has physiological benefits. According to the Harvard Centre on the Developing Child, loving relationships reduce stress hormones in children, leading to better brain development and longterm health.

Success and Achievement: A study in the Journal of Child and Family Studies found that children who feel loved and supported are more likely to excel academically and socially. The encouragement of a loving parent fuels a child’s motivation and sense of purpose.

The science is clear: love is not just a “nice-to-have.” It is essential. But how do we, as busy parents, juggling countless responsibilities, ensure we are expressing our love in ways our children truly feel?

10 Practical Ways to Show Love That Children Can Feel

Children thrive when they experience love in tangible and meaningful ways. Here are ten simple yet powerful ways to ensure your child feels cherished every day:

1. Show Physical Affection: Children crave physical closeness. Hugs, kisses, cuddles, and even a gentle hand on their shoulder can reassure them of your love. These small gestures speak volumes and create a sense of security.

2. Say It Out Loud: Never underestimate the power of saying, “I love you.” But don’t stop there. Verbal affirmations like, “I’m proud of you,” or “You’re so important to me,” nurture their self-esteem and remind them they are valued.

3. Listen with Intention: When your child speaks, give them your full attention. Put down your phone, make eye contact, and engage with their stories or concerns. Active listening makes them feel heard and understood.

4. Prioritize Quality Time: Whether it’s playing a board game, reading together, or simply talking about their day, dedicating undistracted time to your child strengthens your bond and communicates their importance in your life.

5. Celebrate Their Efforts: Recognize their achievements, no matter how small, and comfort them in their failures. Encouragement and support remind children that your love is not conditional on success but is unwavering.

6. Teach with Patience: Discipline is an opportunity to teach, not punish. When children know that guidance comes from love, they are more likely to learn and grow without fear or resentment.

7. Surprise Them: A little surprise can make your child’s day. Write a note for their lunchbox, make their favorite meal, or plan an unexpected outing. These acts of love leave lasting impressions.

8. Be Present: In our digital world, undivided attention is a precious gift. Put down the distractions, and show your child that they have your full focus. Being present is one of the most direct ways to show love.

9. Create Special Traditions: Family rituals, such as bedtime stories, Sunday pancakes, or a weekly game night give children something to look forward to and create cherished memories of love and togetherness.

10. Empathize with Their Feelings: Acknowledge and validate their emotions, whether they are happy, sad, or frustrated. Saying, “I understand why you feel this way,” helps them feel secure and supported.

Why Love Must Be Obvious

While we may believe that love is implied, children interpret the world differently. They thrive on explicit and consistent demonstrations of affection and care. Unlike adults, they cannot always infer love through actions like providing food or keeping a tidy home. They need tangible expressions of love to feel it in their hearts and minds.

When love is not obvious, children may misinterpret our busyness or distractedness as disinterest or even rejection. Over time, this can lead to feelings of insecurity or a lack of self-worth. By making love clear and abundant, we give our children the tools they need to flourish.

The Ripple Effect of Love

As parents, showing love is one of the simplest yet most profound gifts we can give our children. It sets the stage for their emotional and physical well-being, their success, and their capacity to form loving relationships of their own.

By taking small, intentional steps to demonstrate love daily, we lay a foundation for our children to grow into resilient, confident, and compassionate individuals. Love, after all, is not just the bond that connects us; it’s the force that shapes our future.

So today, take a moment to hug your child, tell them how proud you are, or simply listen to their stories. Let them know, in every way possible, just how much they mean to you. Because when children feel deeply loved, they truly have the world at their feet. 

In part 1, we discussed that the classroom environment involves shared experiences among children, families, and teachers, with health and well-being playing a crucial role. Early detection and collaboration between families and teachers can lead to significant benefits, and research-based evidence supports this connection and its consequences.

• Health and well-being are crucial for success in the classroom.

• Research-based evidence supports the strong relationship between health and education.

• High stress and sleep deprivation can lead to negative effects in the classroom, including irritability, focus loss, and low productivity.

• Lifestyle or non-communicable diseases are prevalent and can be minimized to improve functioning and stress management.

• Neuroscience is a key factor in learning, influenced by various health issues such as poor nutrition, lack of exercise, and weakened health.

• These health issues can lead to neuro disorders, mood disorders, non-communicable diseases, stress, and sleep deprivation.

Teaching children about daily exercise, eating nutritiously and sufficient and quality sleep helps them build wellness habits taking them through their lives and contributing to the management of lifetime stressors. Chronic stress has been well-documented with its negative effects on hippocampal structure and function and has been suggested to contribute to age-related declines. “A wide range of potential stressor from across the lifespan include: divorce; discrimination; illness; abuse; poverty; and more.. Exercise engagement would moderate the effects of stress.1 As you see, this also relates directly to the adults in the child’s environment.

Mental and emotional stress during adulthood is often downplayed. However, there are so many cases of this in daily lives. How can one really give of their best. Some people may talk about it, but then others have it bottled up inside. Without an outlet or rectification, explosion is possible along with severe implications later on in life. There is recent evidence showing the impact on chronic stress on the brain where "women exposed to serious stressors in middle age have an increased incidence of Alzheimer’s disease 20 years later. This study is consistent with others showing that distress may hasten dementia. Thus, stress exposure may increase risk of a variety of mental or cognitive disorders. 2

The following table is adapted from CDC - “How Much Sleep Do I Need? 3 They state that “...although the amount of sleep you get each day is important, other aspects of your sleep also contribute to your health and well-being. Good sleep quality is also essential. Signs of poor sleep quality include not feeling rested even after getting enough sleep, repeatedly waking up during the night, and experiencing symptoms of sleep disorders (such as snoring or gasping for air). Improving sleep quality may be helped by better sleep habits or being diagnosed and treated for any sleep disorder you may have.” use of over-the-counter medications or prescribed drugs can alter nutritional status.

Deficiencies in macro (and micro) nutrients, vitamins, and minerals will lead to neural defects. Toxic substances, medication, smoking and alcohol intake by the mother also negatively affects the brain of the foetus. The consequences of these are difficult to address in the classroom and would need the collaborative efforts of a healthcare

TABLE 2: RECOMMENDED DAILY SLEEP HOURS

Newborn 0–3 months 14–17 hours (National Sleep Foundation) No recommendation (American Academy of Sleep Medicine)

Infant 4–12 months 12–16 hours per 24 hours (including naps)

Toddler 1–2 years 11–14 hours per 24 hours (including naps)

Preschool 3–5 years 10–13 hours per 24 hours (including naps)

School Age 6–12 years 9–12 hours per 24 hours

Teen 13–18 years 8–10 hours per 24 hours

Adult 18–60 years 7 or more hours per night 61–64 years 7–9 hours 65 years and older 7–8 hours

Brain development starts in the womb and is susceptible to all ills bestowed consciously and/or unconsciously by the parents; directly by the mother and indirectly by others and the environment. For example, “known causes of disorders of the corpus callosum include chromosomal defects that affect fetal brain development. Certain viral infections that a mother has while pregnant, exposure of the unborn baby to certain toxins (like alcohol) or medications.”4

Parent education within our environment will help bring awareness of the needs of children's development through all stages from inception. The over use of alcohol for instance, in the home has negative consequences on children as they may also be exposed to abuse. Children in these environments will have mental and emotional challenges. There are also medications that can cause the body to leech or not absorb the nutrients it needs; thus, prolonged team from different medical specialties, inclusive of a Registered Dietitian, who is different from someone who is just a Nutritionist. The nutritional well-being of the child, stress management, and physical activities are also important to help in the process, as disruption in these will exacerbate the health status. “There is evidence that exercise affects several important and beneficial processes in the non-injured, as well as in the injured brain.”5

MY WIFE AND I HAVE BEEN CONSIDERING PRESCHOOLS FOR OUR ACTIVE THREE-YEAR-OLD. OUR CHILD LOVES TO BE “ON THE MOVE” AND IS HAPPIEST BEING BUSY. WE THOUGHT A MONTESSORI SCHOOL MIGHT BE A GOOD FIT FOR SUCH AN ACTIVE PERSONALITY. WE EXPECTED TO SEE A BIG OPEN SPACE WITH LOTS OF ROOM FOR THEM TO BE ACTIVE AND MOVE FREELY. BUT IT SEEMS TO BE THE SAME IN EVERY ROOM WE VISIT; THERE’S ONE BIG RUG SPACE, AND MOST OF THE ROOM IS DIVIDED INTO SMALLER SPACES.

CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHY AND CALM OUR FEARS THAT OUR ACTIVE CHILD WILL REALLY GET ENOUGH MOVEMENT DURING THE MORNING? — DAD

Dear Dad,

Thank you for your concerns. As the mom of a son who seemed a lot like yours as a young child, I can totally identify with your worries.

The Montessori classroom for 3-6-yearold children is designed to resemble a children’s house. It is scaled down in size to be a perfect fit for young children and is divided by area; think of it like rooms in a house. The shelves of materials or activities often divide the room helping the children to see where each area ends and begins. Inside each area is workspace where children can choose to put their work rugs if they so desire. Child-sized tables are also placed in some areas, so table work can be encouraged to happen in that space. There are areas for one child to work as well as group activities.

The big work rug that you noticed in each classroom serves as both a gathering space for the entire class when they have their ‘circle time” or “class meeting” and as a space to spread out and do larger rug works and partner activities. This rug is often filled with the happenings of many children during the morning, which creates opportunities for your young child to see, absorb, and aspire to these.

The Montessori philosophy seeks to “control the environment and not the child.” Running is not permitted in the classroom due to safety concerns, so we make the pathways in the classroom too narrow for running. Long stretches of space are obstructed with furniture, so they are not inviting areas in which to run. Children must walk carefully in order to not bump into anything. This helps them learn to move carefully within the classroom while still meeting their need for movement. The work rugs that are laid out on the floor create a sort of natural maze for the child to walk through. This creates a fun and sometimes challenging experience of careful walking in the classroom.

Classrooms have a line drawn or taped on the floor, and children are taught to walk on that line. First, they simply walk on that line. Later, they carry things that are of greater and greater difficulty. This is a very popular movement activity for young children.

Many of the activities in the classroom also require movement to do them. A child may build the Pink Tower (a set of 10 graduated cubes from 10cm – 1cm) across the room with the random cubes on one rug and the emerging tower in order on another rug across the room. This is an enticing activity for young children. They may collect objects of a single color from around the room and bring them to their rug. They may match the pictures of the children in their class to the real children. These types of works keep children moving all morning, and yes, their need for movement is satisfied in a Montessori classroom. Children also choose the amount of movement that is right for them. They have choices as to which activity they select, how long they work with it, and when they are finished. They might choose to have a “water break” or a snack break” in the middle of an activity or between activities.

Some classrooms have designated movement shelves with activities, such as yoga

Cathie cards, jumping circles that can be laid out, or other movement activities. Children may choose to turn over a timer and jog in a square to expend energy or lay out a walking path and move like an animal as they navigate the path.

The Montessori classroom provides natural opportunities for movement. The purpose of the classroom is to help the child refine their movements as they mature. It will assist your child in learning to develop greater self-control and purposeful movement as they grow their skill level. There are opportunities for gross-motor skills during circle time when the class plays group games as well as during free play outside each day. The balance of these myriads of movement-rich experiences will allow your child many opportunities for growth and development. 

    content: `by Lorna McGrath and Tim Seldin

Sarah Chen stood in her living room, staring at the catalog of Montessori materials spread across her coffee table. Her daughter Emma had just started at a local Montessori school, and Sarah was torn about whether to invest in some of the beautiful wooden materials she'd seen in Emma's classroom. Like many parents, she wondered if having these materials at home would give her child an extra advantage.

This common parental impulse (to provide educational materials at home that mirror the school environment) comes from a good place. However, Montessori educators and experienced parents have found that the relationship between school and home learning can be more nuanced than it might first appear.

"When parents ask us about purchasing Montessori materials for home use, we often encourage them to pause and reflect," says Maria Torres, a Montessori guide with 15 years of experience. "The magic of these materials in the classroom setting comes partly from their novelty and the way they're presented. When children have unlimited access to them at home, it can actually diminish their special appeal in the classroom."

This doesn't mean your home can't support your child's Montessori education, quite the opposite! The key lies in understanding the deeper principles of the Montessori approach and finding creative ways to apply them in your home environment without duplicating the classroom experience.

Consider the kitchen, for instance. Rather than purchasing specialized Montessori practical life materials, you might create a designated space where your child can independently access appropriately sized tools for food preparation. A low drawer with child-sized implements allows children to make their own snacks, pour their own drinks, and help with meal preparation. Likewise, set up the lowest shelf in the refrigerator to hold wholesome snacks and drinks that they can prepare. This approach not only develops the same skills as classroom materials but does so in a real-world context that children find deeply satisfying.

The same principle applies to other areas of development. Instead of investing in the iconic Pink Tower or Brown Stairs, parents can create rich sensorial experiences through everyday activities. Elizabeth Morgan, a parent of two Montessori students, discovered this organically. "We started taking nature walks and collecting objects of different sizes, weights, and textures," she explains. "My children became fascinated with comparing pinecones, sorting rocks, and creating their own classification systems. It dawned on us that this was Montessori thinking in action, without any specialized materials."

"My children became fascinated with comparing pinecones, sorting rocks, and creating their own classification systems. It dawned on us that this was Montessori thinking in action, without any specialized materials."

Language development provides another opportunity for organic learning at home. While Montessori

classrooms use specific materials, such as Sandpaper Letters and a Movable Alphabet, home language experiences can be woven naturally throughout the day. Rich conversations during meals, storytelling at bedtime, and casual writing opportunities, such as helping to make shopping lists, all support literacy development without requiring specialized materials.

When it comes to mathematics, daily life offers countless opportunities for mathematical thinking. Counting stairs as you climb them, measuring ingredients while cooking, or sorting laundry all develop mathematical understanding in meaningful ways. These real-life applications often prove more valuable than having formal mathematical materials at home.

There are, however, times when purchasing specific Montessori materials might make sense. Your child's teacher might recommend particular materials to support specific learning needs, or you might want certain items for extended breaks from school. In these cases, the key is to communicate openly with your child's guide about what would be most beneficial.

Some parents have found creative middle-ground solutions. The Wilson family, for instance, created a rotating selection of seasonal materials that complement, rather than duplicate, classroom work. During summer, they might bring out materials for nature study and gardening. In winter, they focus on Practical Life skills, such as food preparation and craft work. This approach keeps activities fresh and engaging while supporting their children's development.

The most successful home environments typically

focus on creating opportunities for independence, concentration, and Practical Life skills rather than academic materials. A thoughtfully prepared space might include a designated area for artistic expression, easily accessible shelves for books and activities, and child-sized furniture that allows for autonomous movement and work.

As Sarah Chen eventually discovered, creating a supportive home environment had less to do with purchasing specific materials and more to do with applying Montessori principles in daily life. "Once we shifted our focus from materials to opportunities," she reflects, "we started seeing possibilities everywhere. Our home became a place where learning happened naturally, through living."

This approach not only supports children's development but also maintains the special relationship they have with their classroom environment. After all, the goal isn't to recreate school at home but to create a complementary space where children can continue to grow and develop in their own unique way.

The beauty of this approach lies in its simplicity and authenticity. By focusing on real-life experiences and genuine opportunities for independence, parents can create an environment that genuinely supports their child's Montessori education. No specialized materials required! 

Sacagawea

 

by KitsonJazynka

I was fortunate to travel the Columbia River in Washington State in late summer 2024. While on the cruise we learned a great deal about the Lewis and Clark expedition and Sacagawea. National Geographic Kids publishes many wonderful readers for children at different reading levels. I recommend any books in their reading series. This book is written for children who are fluent readers. It is set up with interesting information and illustrations, as well as with vocabulary that may be new to some readers. The new words are defined after they are used in context and include a pronunciation guide. At the back of the book is a glossary, an index, and a quick quiz.

 

I learned interesting and factual information about Sacagawea’s life, her experiences on the journey, and her important contributions to the success of the Corps of Discovery. It is an engaging book for young readers in the elementary years.

Seaman’s Journal: On the Trail with Lewis and Clark & Illustrated by Patricia Reeder Eubank

As I took my first glances through the pages I thought, “Wow! Eye-catching illustrations!” They are colorful, realistic, and give readers almost as much information as the text.

Seaman was a Newfoundland dog, owned by Captain Meriwether Lewis. Seaman traveled with Captain Lewis

and the Corps of Discovery across what is now the United States. The author chose to write this book as if Seaman was writing.

The events in this story are based on Lewis’s journal. It is a captivating account of the 8,000-mile journey across America to the Pacific Ocean and back from a dog’s eye view! Children from 5 to 10 years old will not only enjoy it but will learn a great deal about this historic adventure.

Something, Someday

Written by Amanda Gorman, Presidential Inaugural Poet 2016

Illustrated by Christian Robinson

Amanda Gorman once again has written a poem for children that is full of determination, hope, and friendship. The essence of this piece is about how to make a difference in our world. According to her poem, the keys are to have a vision of how it might work, the need to keep working even in small increments, keep hope in your heart, and others will gather around as friends and helpers with the same vision. What I imagined as I read this

book is another project that I and others are working on, unrelated to cleaning up our world (recycling, repurposing, reusing), and I thought these same principles could be applied to many different ideas, projects, and plans. It’s so simple and yet profound.

The illustrations are reminiscent of Ezra Jack Keats's work. Very nicely done, including diversity in ages, races, and physical abilities, and shown in an urban environment.

I would recommend this book for children ages 4-8 years old. I would also recommend that parents, caregivers, or classroom teachers read this book to a child or children. Then explore together what possibilities there are, or might be, in life for making sometimes seemingly impossible dreams into reality.

Emmy in the Key of Code

Written by Aime Lucida

“A definite book to teach you about code, life, and the essence of computer programming.”

I am 11 years old, and I love this book. I read it twice! It taught me about coding and how to handle life. Emmy in the Key of Code is a realistic fiction book about a twelve-year-old girl who needs to make music to save her life.

Emmy is a 6th grader and is the protagonist of the story. She faces lots of challenges that are outside her comfort zone. Emmy goes into a new school where she meets Abigail who helps Emmy find the way to make music with her new life of coding. Abigail is Emmy’s best friend and faces the challenge of making her own decisions while helping others. Ms. Delaney is Emmy’s computer teacher and teaches Java and binary code. In the book, Emmy’s first computer program was Hello World. Hello, World is the first code new programmers use to get the hang of coding with any computer language. Francis is the antagonist of Emmy and makes her feel like an outsider of coding; however, girls were the first computer scientists.

In this book, you get to meet Jeopardy, who is Emmy's loved golden retriever. One of my favorite lines from the book is when Emmy made music with her computer coding: “Public, Static, Void, Main, String, Bracket, Bracket, Args!” which are the building blocks of Java coding.

What makes this book interesting to me is that Aimee Lucido balanced the antagonist’s moves and the protagonist’s moves. Lucido wrote this book uniquely by writing words in a whole

new way. For example, she scattered the words all over the page. Emmy in the Key of Code is a book I would read over and over again. A perfect book for people interested in coding.

Wildwood

Written by Colin Meloy

In Colin Meloy’s fantasy adventure novel Wildwood (the first book in a trilogy), the story follows two seventh graders on their journey through a magical forest to rescue a baby who has been kidnapped by crows. Along the way, they are caught in a deeper plot of an age-old conflict that, if left to play out, could lead to a disastrous ending for everyone involved.

Leading an ordinary life in Portland, Oregon, twelve-year-old Prue Mckeel lives with her parents and baby brother, Mac. She is a skilled artist who is intelligent, courageous, and a true warrior that has been warned of one

thing since she was young: Never venture into the Impassable Wilderness. One day in the park, she is looking after Mac, when suddenly a “murder” of crows swoops down and carries him into, you guessed it, the dreadful Impassable Wilderness. Determined to find her brother and bring him home, she braves the journey with her classmate Curtis Mehlberg, encountering fantastical animals and a civilization that has been hidden for years.

Wildwood is a coming-of-age tale full of magic, danger, suspense, and wonder. I would recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys a good fantasy book, but more specifically ages 10-13, as I feel they will be able to connect and relate much better with our two protagonists.

Some things I enjoyed about this book are the beautiful, detailed illustrations done by Carson Ellis that are sprinkled throughout the story. These especially help if you have trouble with visual imagery or simply want the author’s perspective about what is happening. Another thing I enjoyed is the writing style. It is clear and easy to understand, while still holding detail and depth. This is a bit of a longer book, spanning around 540 pages, but it is worth the read as it transports you into the exciting world of Wildwood.

I rate this book 5 stars.

    content: `When we have visitors and tours in our classroom, I often wonder what parents and caregivers think when they see our mixed-age students working together. I see these families walk into our classroom observing something most of them probably haven’t seen before. I was a student once, too, in a traditional classroom, where all the students worked with the same material at the same time, using worksheets.

I also remember some students falling behind and trying to play catch-up while others were ahead of the game. Regardless of our individual, unique situations, we just had to do the same thing at the same time. In kindergarten, we jumped straight into abstract work, which created other challenges. We were not allowed to ask our classmates for help, take a break, move around the room, and certainly would never think of using the bathroom without asking for permission.

There is so much research now showing the importance of moving while learning, as it ignites areas of the brain that improve concentration; increase retention; and relieve stress.

What I love about the flow in a Montessori classroom is how students move slowly from concrete material to abstract lessons as they become ready. I wish I had experienced the same type of lessons and process during my early learning and throughout my academic growth, especially in math. I sincerely believe I would have been a better student had I developed a foundation in math based on a concrete understanding.

It is beautiful to see students work while they get help from their peers, increasing interaction, and developing role-model skills. The older children build patience, tolerance, empathy, and confidence. They inspire the younger children, who are learning different skills, (social, emotional, cognitive, and academic) from their older peers.

Mixed-age group classrooms contain a diversity of material that challenges the children’s unique needs in different areas. Through peer education, children work together and learn from each other. The children learn at a relaxed pace, without the stress that comes from competition and comparison with their peers that is found in many traditional learning environments. A learning environment that prioritizes individual goals and progress with peer education fosters a positive, collaborative classroom, where children can be themselves and flourish at their own pace. 

In the classroom, many experiences are shared by children, families, and teachers. Success depends on many factors, with health and well-being playing major roles. The more one delves into this, the clearer it becomes how impactful these factors are and how crucial it is to include them in observation categories. Early detection would make significant differences, and the benefits would be far-reaching. Understanding the connection would allow families to collaborate more effectively, benefiting everyone involved. Research-based evidence provides the foundation for demonstrating the strong relationship between health and learning, as well as the consequences of neglecting it. This article draws on scientific evidence to support health education.

Diseases, ailments, high levels of stress, and sleep deprivation (both in terms of hours and quality) have negative consequences that show up in the classroom in various ways: irritability, loss of focus, lack of concentration, low productivity, and absenteeism, to name a few. Many lifestyle or non-communicable diseases, which can often be minimized or eradicated, affect our ability to function optimally and manage life’s stressors.

From a professional perspective, it would be remiss to focus solely on neuroscience and learning without considering other factors that ultimately affect the brain and have a negative domino effect on learning. Poor nutrition, lack of exercise, and weakened health status adversely affect brain function, leading to an inability to learn effectively. Therefore, this article discusses neuroscience alongside other health issues, including neuro disorders, mood disorders, non-communicable diseases, stress, and sleep deprivation. These affect not only children but also the adults in their environment, who serve as role models in both direct and indirect learning. As Julia Volkman notes, "Our brains physically adapt as we strive to be like the people around us."

Teachers are part of the child’s environment and learning process, so they must take the time to care for themselves, preparing both physically and mentally to serve children in a healthy way and set a good example. As Dr. Maria Montessori wrote, "Now the adult himself is part of the child's environment" (The Secret of Childhood). A teacher in poor health will create a ripple effect on a child’s learning. How can one think clearly, or manage a frustrated child or parent, when one is ill? When internally distracted or sick, how can one concentrate, be observant, or fully present? A teacher's absenteeism, mood changes, dehydration, or weakened immune system can negatively impact their interactions with students. In turn, frustrated moments affect a student’s learning as they try to cope with how they are feeling.

Children observe and often mimic the behaviors of adults around them. As Montessori said, “The child reproduces in himself, as by a form of psychic mimesis, the characteristics of the people in his environment.” It is vital to understand lifestyle diseases and the habits responsible for them. Young children, lacking the maturity to fully identify or express their feelings or underlying problems, are not in control of these factors. A poor or skipped breakfast or dehydration, will leave children irritable, unfocused, or misbehaving—not because they are inherently disruptive, but because their brain and body are not adequately nourished.

A common sign of dehydration is a headache, and no one can focus with a headache. According to Adan in Cognitive Performance and Dehydration, “being dehydrated by just 2 percent impairs performance in tasks that require attention, psychomotor skills, and immediate memory, as well as one’s subjective state.” Furthermore, research by Popkin et al. notes that “physical performance decrements in athletes have been observed with as little as 2 percent dehydration. Under mild dehydration, individuals engaging in rigorous physical activity experience reduced endurance, increased fatigue, altered thermoregulation, reduced motivation, and increased perceived effort.” Rehydration reverses these deficits and reduces oxidative stress induced by exercise and dehydration (Popkin, Barry M., et al., 2010).

These factors should not be overlooked and should be added to our checklist of concerns. Waiting to feel thirsty is a bad habit; thirst means the body is already dehydrated to some degree. Thirst equals dehydration. Throughout the day, we can become so engrossed in activities that we forget to drink water. This can also happen during a child’s work cycle, so it’s important to allow frequent water breaks and make conscious efforts to build hydration into the classroom routine. The table shows the adequate daily fluid intake in milliliters.

Ratios for water intake based on the AI for water in liters/day calculated using EER for each range of physical activity. EER adapted from the Institue of Medicine Dietary Reference Intakes Macronutrients Report, 2002.

The Role of Nutrition and Hydration

Many parents know the importance of breakfast, but it’s easy to overlook just how vital it is to your child’s school day. Skipping breakfast or eating sugary, processed foods can leave children feeling tired, irritable, and unable to concentrate. They may "misbehave" simply because their brains aren’t getting the nutrients they need.

Dehydration can also cause problems. Just a small amount of dehydration—about 2 percent—can lead to headaches and make it hard to focus. Research shows that dehydration affects children’s attention span, memory, and even their ability to complete simple tasks. To avoid this, encourage your child to drink water regularly throughout the day, not just when they feel thirsty. Once you feel thirsty, you’re already somewhat dehydrated. So, building regular water breaks into your child’s routine can make a big difference in their ability to stay focused and calm during the school day.

Practical Tips for Parents

• Start the day with a healthy breakfast. A balanced meal with protein, whole grains, and healthy fats will give your child lasting energy.

• Encourage regular water intake. Send children to school with a water bottle and remind them to drink regularly.

• Promote physical activity. Regular exercise not only keeps children fit but also helps them concentrate better in school.

• Ensure adequate sleep. A consistent sleep routine is vital for brain function and emotional regulation.

• Model healthy habits. Children are always watching, so if you prioritize your own health, they’re more likely to follow suit.

Healthy children are better learners. Small changes in your child’s daily habits can significantly impact their ability to focus, stay calm, and thrive in school.

    content: `Many parents believe that the word discipline means to punish. In reality, it means to teach.

Testing your limits

Every child will test the rules to some degree. In fact, most acts of testing parents are a normal part of a child’s process of growing up. When children test adults, it is often their way of expressing feelings that they don’t understand, and from our responses, they gradually learn how to handle their emotions appropriately. By testing the limits, they learn that we really care about certain ground rules of grace and courtesy in our relationships. In acting out, they are taking their first tentative steps towards independence, attempting to demonstrate that we don’t control them completely.

 

Family ground rules

Some families have far too many rules when all that is needed are some basic guidelines that underpin what we expect and hope from all members of the human race. There is no need to be creative and think up something to govern every aspect of your children’s lives. Agree on your family's ground rules and get them written down and displayed so that both parents and caregivers can refer to them. Teach your child how to do the right thing rather than focusing on their mistakes. In the Montessori-inspired home, there are usually just a few basic rules.

• Treat everyone with respect.

• If you use something, put it back correctly when you are finished.

• If you break or spill something, clean it up.

• Tell the truth, and don’t be afraid to admit when you make a mistake.

You should be absolutely clear in your mind about your family's ground rules. Explain them positively rather than as prohibitions. Instead of saying, “Don’t do that!” the rules should tell your child what to do. Teach them how to follow them as if you were teaching any lesson in everyday life skills. Model the same behaviors that you are trying to encourage in your child. Consciously try to catch your child doing something right and reinforce and acknowledge even the small steps they are taking in the right direction. Don’t wait until they have mastered a new skill; encourage them along the way.

When your child breaks a ground rule, you can do several things other than scold, threaten, or punish.

You can redirect them by suggesting a more appropriate choice. You can remind them of the ground rule and politely (but firmly) ask them to stop. If the situation is not emotionally charged (that is, if you are not personally aggravated), you can re-teach the basic lesson about how to handle such situations.

Be consistent. If you find that you cannot bring yourself to reinforce a rule, again and again, it should not be a ground rule. A few good rules are much better than dozens that are often ignored.

Teaching tidiness

Show your child how to put their toys away after they have finished playing with them.

Reducing Power Struggles

Sooner or later, every child will stubbornly say, “No, I don’t want to!” This is the power struggle that starts in the toddler years and often continues throughout childhood and adolescence. Many people call the toddler stage the “terrible twos,” but it doesn’t have to be—not with two-year-olds or with older children.

Power struggles start in situations where parents and children are determined to get their own way, and neither party is willing to back down. Underneath, each feels frustrated and threatened. Parents feel that their children are directly challenging their authority. Children in situations such as this are usually feeling powerless. They are attempting to assert their autonomy and establish more of a balance of power in their relationship with their parents.

Don’t punish, teach.

Threats and punishments are not good tools for getting children to behave. When children are angry or asserting their independence, they often misbehave and don’t care if they are punished.

Those children who do respond to threats and are shaken by punishments are anxious to please us and win back our love. Arguably, these children will respond just as well to other forms of discipline. While punishments tend to produce immediate results, they are rarely long-lasting.

Explaining ground rules positively

Teach your child how to handle certain situations rather than scold or punish them.

Strategies for minimizing power struggles

Here are some strategies to help reduce the number of power struggles and the use of the word “No!” you and your children can get most, if not all, of what you are after.

Power struggles can be minimized by giving your child meaningful levels of independence and responsibility in everyday life. This makes her feel powerful and grown up.

Reserve “no” for really important issues, such as an activity that might harm your child, others, or one that causes damage.

 

Give your children choices. Whenever you can, look for ways to let your children choose between two equally acceptable alternatives. “Would you like to have water or milk with your dinner?”

Teach your child to politely say “no”: “Mom, I really do not feel like doing that now.”

Teach your child to do things correctly and emphasize the positive rather than using anger. Above all else, try never to ask your child unanswerable questions, such as, “How many times do I have to tell you?” to which the response would be, “I don’t know, Dad! How many times do you have to tell me?”

Teaching Lessons In Grace And Courtesy At Home

Practicing games that teach good manners can help your child learn how to behave well in any company. Here are some more ideas for lessons in grace and courtesy:

Keep in mind Robert Heinlein’s golden rule of family life: “Kindness and courtesy are even more important between husbands and wives and parents and children than between total strangers.”

Don’t simply give in; look for ways that might allow you to back down gracefully. Often, through compromise, both

• Saying “please” and “thank you.”

• Using a kind tone when speaking to your child: no whining or yelling.

 

 

• Asking for a turn or if you can play too.

• Introducing yourself.

• Opening and closing doors.

• Coughing and sneezing in a way that protects others.

• Giving people compliments and encouragement.

• Allowing others to pass in front of you or to go first.

 

• Saying “excuse me” if you bump into someone.

• Responding politely when someone calls you or says your name.

• Walking around areas where other children are working or playing on the floor and not stepping over them.

• Learning how to wait.

• Not interrupting other people when they are talking.

• Answering the telephone politely.

Good Manners

In Montessori schools, the “lessons in grace and courtesy” (exercises that set a tone of respect and kindness) are taught alongside the more conventional subjects in the curriculum.

We show our children how to shake hands, greet a friend, and say goodbye. We demonstrate how to politely interrupt someone who is busy and how to tell someone, “no, thank you.” We teach children how to speak indoors and how to play nicely. We show them how to offer a sincere apology and how to resolve conflicts peacefully. We help children develop body control through balance and coordination lessons, which foster grace and courtesy.

We teach children grace, which is how to move thoughtfully. This allows them to navigate spaces without bumping into others or dropping items and to enter a room with awareness and composure.

As parents, we can teach our children socially appropriate behavior using similar Montessori strategies.

Simple Lessons

The first step is to explain a situation and demonstrate the right way to handle it. Then, have your child practice with you. Children enjoy these lessons if they are kept short, and if they are not embarrassed by making a mistake.

For example, if your children tend to yell at the top of their lungs inside the house, you need to show them how to keep the noise to a level that does not disturb other people. As it is happening, politely ask your child to speak softly. Then, choose a moment when neither of you is upset to give them a lesson on the right way to speak indoors.

Speak in simple language. You might say: “I want to talk to you about indoor voices. When we are outdoors, it’s so big, and sometimes we need to shout so we can hear each other. When we are outdoors, it doesn’t hurt our ears when someone talks loudly, so we can use our outdoor voices. But when we are indoors, it hurts our ears if we talk too loudly. When we are indoors, we need to use our indoor voices.”

Now, show your child what you mean. Talk very loudly and ask, “Was I using my indoor voice or my outdoor voice?” Talk normally. “What do you think? Was I using my indoor or my outdoor voice?”

You can teach all sorts of lessons this way, everything from saying “please” and “thank you” to closing doors quietly. Some families have the "manner of the week." They introduce a new courtesy rule each week and practice it over meals and around the house.

Role Models

To teach children good manners, they need to see that their parents follow them consistently as well. The example that we set through our behavior is more powerful than anything we say. Children absorb everything they see us do, especially when they are very young, and soon, they begin to talk and act just like us. We are their role models.

Bearing in mind that your child will be influenced profoundly by the people around them, engage them in a discussion about the behavior of the children and adults with whom they spend their time—grandparents, cousins, family friends, playmates, etc. It is not your place to judge your extended family or other people’s families and how they behave, nor is this something you can control or avoid. Instead, be curious and ask questions that help your child navigate these differences.

Often, parents worry about the “negative influence” of others and seek to protect their children from these experiences. Still, exposure to different behaviors, value systems, cultures, and parenting styles can be seen as opportunities for your child to practice grace and courtesy, inclusion, tolerance, and your family values in different contexts.

Learning Kindness, Courtesy, and Manners in Practice

Children learn by example, but they can also be shown how to behave in a caring way through role play. Present these short exercises in calm moments rather than using them to point out a mistake.

Meet and greet: Teach your child the correct way to welcome visitors into their home.

Table manners: Show your child how to pull a chair out and put it back and how to sit down on it correctly.

Careful carrying: Teach your child how to bring something to you, carrying it using both hands and then to set it down correctly.

Care and compassion: Encourage your child to show concern for a friend who is upset.

Coordination and control: Have your child practice walking carefully along a line and watching where they are going to improve balance and coordination.

Saying goodbye: Your child starts to learn friendship skills when they are shown how to offer warm greetings and goodbyes. 

AS FAIRLY NEW PARENTS, WE ARE WATCHING OUR CHILDREN BEGIN TO DEVELOP INTO WHO THEY WILL BE, AND WE REALIZE THAT WE SHOULD ALSO BE PURPOSEFUL IN MOLDING THEM INTO THE KIND OF PEOPLE WE WANT THEM TO BECOME. WE ARE LOOKING FOR IDEAS AS TO HOW TO DO THAT! WHERE DO WE START AND WHAT SHOULD WE FOCUS ON? CAN YOU OFFER ANY INSIGHT ON THIS SUBJECT?

— PROACTIVE PARENTS

Dear Parents,

We applaud you for being proactive in considering your child’s development from the macro point of view. Raising children is one of the most difficult, challenging and important things you will ever do. One way to accomplish that task is to let your children share in your activities as you go through your daily life. Let your child see and understand your values through your actions.

As your young children see you living purposefully in the moment, you can invite them to share the joys of those daily experiences to the best of their abilities based on their age. Let’s use laundry as an example. A two-year-old can pull the laundry out of the dryer and put it in the laundry basket so it can be carried to the sofa to be folded. However, a three-year-old can match the socks into pairs, while a fouryear-old can actually fold the pants in half and sort them into piles for the different members of the family. Everyone is contributing to the work of being in a family while moving on the path towards ultimate self-reliance.

A common worry is children having expectations or feelings of entitlement. One way to minimize this in your family is to regularly cook with your children. Make the creation of a meal a family affair! Invite all members of the family to help you plan meals. Include your children in the purchasing of food, preparing food and cleaning up the kitchen after the meal. Perhaps your child can help put away the groceries, cut the vegetables, clean the crumbs, wash the dishes or put away the leftovers. This helps your child feel like a contributing member of the family, rather than just having the food appear upon the table magically! It is also a way to spend regular quality time together!

Include your children in your philanthropic work or doing for others in your community in whatever form that takes. Make a point to think past yourself and discuss this thinking openly and frequently with your children. Choose a family charity (or even a few charities) and work to make them a part of your family’s culture. This could start as small as giving home-made cookies to your neighbors or your child’s teacher or the school bus driver to choosing a way to help others at holiday time. It could also be service based, checking on an elderly neighbor or shoveling the driveway for somebody who is ill or disabled.

Be sure your child is involved in all aspects of these projects even though it can be more complicated and time consuming. This will help children to begin thinking outside their own bubble. If your family has little to give, you can include your children in recycling used toys to an organization for children in need, instilling the value of compassion.

As children develop, your goal for them is for them to learn to take their responsibilities seriously and grow into global citizens who will work to make the world a better place. Parents begin this effort when their children are very young with the intent to mold their children with lifelong values, where children see and participate in family activities with their parents. Your children are aware of everything you say and do. Why not use your daily chores and activities as a basis for their in-home education with you. What a wonderful opportunity and awesome experience. Enjoy this limited and special time together.

    content: `The Hidden Power of Practical Life Skills in Montessori

by Tim Seldin

"All activities connected with caring for oneself and the environment—like getting dressed, preparing food, setting the table, wiping floors, clearing dishes—these are tasks that adults often avoid. Yet, for children between one and four, these jobs are a source of joy, and they eagerly rise to the invitation to participate." — Dr. Silvana Montanaro

"I love Montessori! I get to make snacks and serve them to my friends. It’s like being a real waiter." — Phillip, age 5

This photograph from a century ago shows a young Montessori child ladling soup for her classmates at lunchtime. It's easy to imagine her parents asking the same question many do today: “What does this have to do with learning to read or write?” In Montessori, Practical Life activities—such as washing tables, pouring water, polishing, sweeping, and dusting—are not just chores; they are foundational learning experiences.

 

 

Through these hands-on tasks, children develop an inner sense of order, focus, and independence. By caring for their environment, meeting their own needs, and helping others, Montessori students learn more than just skills—they learn how to learn.

Here’s a glimpse into a Montessori day that captures this philosophy:

It’s 10 o’clock, and Amani is hungry. She heads over to the snack table and prepares celery sticks with peanut butter, pouring herself apple juice from a pitcher made for small hands. When she finishes, Amani carefully wipes her placemat. This inspires her to clean, so she gathers a small bucket, sponge, brush, towel, and soap, and she starts methodically washing a table.

 

 

As she scrubs, she’s absorbed by the patterns of the soap suds. When she's done, she tidies up, leaving the table somewhat clean—but that’s not the point. What Amani is truly learning is patience, independence, and the ability to concentrate on a sequence of steps.

 

 

Another child, Meredith, sees that the windows need to be cleaned. She gathers the window-washing kit and begins to spray a nontoxic solution on the glass. She uses a small squeegee and wipes it with a clean cloth. When done, she moves on, choosing activities that interest her.

In a Montessori classroom, children are genuinely responsible for their space. When hungry, they prepare snacks; when spills happen, they clean up. They practice self-care and community care—each action cultivating confidence and independence.

A Foundation Beyond Skills

Montessori isn’t just about teaching children to count or read; it’s about shaping the people they will become. We focus on developing self-discovery, resilience, and a joyful pursuit of knowledge. This isn’t merely an academic education but an education of the heart and mind. In this setting, children learn with patience, curiosity, and a sense of personal responsibility.

Montessori’s classroom for children between three and six years old is called a Children’s House—a true community of young children. Dr. Maria Montessori’s vision was not to create a more advanced kindergarten but an empowering environment where children are respected as individuals. Here, they develop social and emotional connections, form lasting friendships, and take pride in their shared responsibility for the space and each other.

As children thrive in this nurturing community, they begin to believe in themselves. In this atmosphere, they maintain their natural curiosity and willingness to explore. They learn that mistakes are not failures but stepping stones to growth. With this foundation, they grow to view learning as a journey rather than a destination.

 

 

Growing up this way

As a child, I attended the Barrie School in Washington, D.C. Barrie was founded by my mother in 1932. Later,

I returned to teach and eventually served as headmaster for 22 years.

As a child, I remember arriving at school on frosty mornings, stopping by the kitchen for a piece of toast or some cereal, and helping myself with a bit of guidance from older students. As we grew, so did our contributions to the school.

Barrie was a community of several hundred children ranging in age from two to eighteen. Our food was made in the school kitchen, and older students volunteered to help with preparation. I spent mornings peeling potatoes and stirring stew alongside our cook, Edith, and friends.

After meals, we carried dishes back to the kitchen, washed them by hand, swept sidewalks, watered gardens, fed animals, and tutored younger students.

These daily acts connected us with everyone on campus— from bus drivers to teachers. They taught us the importance of community, and to this day, I still enjoy washing dishes.

The Lifelong Value of Practical Life Skills

“In the special environment prepared for the child, they express an inner need: ‘Help me to do it by myself!’

In Montessori, the classroom itself is a “children’s house,” where children play an active role in caring for the space. They prepare snacks, clean tables, sweep floors, and organize shelves. Through these activities, they learn much more than basic tasks; they develop self-respect, resilience, and a love for learning.

 

 

Confidence grows when children feel capable and independent. Montessori classrooms are designed to foster this growth. Here, children’s actions say, “Help me learn to do it for myself!” By encouraging them to be self-sufficient and organized, we set the stage for a lifetime of strong work habits and a sense of responsibility.

Independence does not magically appear as children grow; it must be nurtured. In Montessori, children start young, learning to tie their shoes or pour their own milk. Small successes like these lead to a sense of confidence and pride.

 

 

As they mature, Montessori students learn Practical Life skills that prepare them for daily living, like cooking, sewing, managing money, gardening, and even simple home repairs. However, perhaps the most essential skill is learning how to work and play with others kindly. Kindness and respect are daily practices in the Montessori classroom, where children learn to be thoughtful and responsible toward their community. They learn to treat themselves and others with dignity.

Montessori schools aim to be close-knit communities where people learn together in an atmosphere of warmth, respect, and cooperation. Teachers are mentors and guides, helping children grow in understanding and compassion for each other’s unique backgrounds and interests.

Montessori Practical Life activities are the heart of Montessori education. They teach children to be confident, responsible, and independent human beings who find joy in learning and meaningful work. 

    content: `by Joyce St.Giermaine

It's a sunny morning at Oakwood Montessori School, and inside the brightly lit classrooms, a quiet buzz fills the air. In one corner, Maya (a fourth-grader) is constructing a model of a Roman arch, while Jacob (a fifth-grader) is busy calculating irregular shapes' areas with Montessori geometry materials. Both are focused and seem to be motivated by inner curiosity.

Maya and Jacob have been in Montessori since they were toddlers, and most days are filled with moments of discovery. Today, for Maya, it's exploring history through building this scale model of a Roman arch that holds together without mortar. For Jacob, it's the satisfying moment when a challenging math problem clicks into place. They are, however, quietly developing something more enduring: self-reliance, critical thinking, and resilience; these are characteristics that will serve them well when they eventually shift to more traditional middle or high schools.

The elementary Montessori learning environment is clearly different from the traditional classrooms students may experience later. The area feels more like a studio or workshop than a typical classroom. Students move around and choose their activities, working alone or with a few others. This is a hallmark of the Montessori approach. It allows students like Maya and Jacob to explore their interests while still meeting set learning goals.

Claire, the Upper Elementary Montessori guide, observed, “They're not just working because they have to. They’re engaged in work that they choose, which develops a much deeper connection to knowing.”

Jacob enjoys challenging math problems. He says that he has been spending as much time as he can on geometry for weeks. "He's able to dive deep into subjects that interest him," Claire describes. “And he's establishing the discipline to keep going even when things get difficult.”

Maya's experience with hands-on learning is typical in Montessori education. Through tasks like constructing a Roman aqueduct, she's not simply discovering ancient civilizations; she's learning more about engineering, team effort, and the value of water systems in society. She may not recognize it, but the flexibility to explore principles in such an experiential way is laying the groundwork for how she'll approach finding out for the rest of her life.

What's not obvious to the casual observer is that both Maya and Jacob are likewise sharpening skills that will reduce their ultimate shift to more conventional school settings. They are finding out how to handle their time, set objectives, and evaluate their progress with increasing self-reliance and very little assistance from trainers.

Navigating Freedom and Responsibility

In Montessori, children like Maya and Jacob have a substantial quantity of autonomy. Each day, they choose the work on which they want to concentrate, stabilizing their interests with the academic requirements. Although this technique might seem disorganized, it promotes a strong sense of obligation and self-motivation.

families invest an evening in the class for the students to share their work and projects.”

This capability to self-manage makes Montessori students especially well-prepared for the next steps in their education. In a traditional middle or high school, where deadlines are strict and schedules are set, this self-discipline will help them thrive.

Tanya, Maya's mom, is confident that Maya will be ready for life after Montessori. "She currently has the skills to manage her work effectively. She has ownership of her education."

Montessori Elementary education is not just about letting children explore; it's about preparing them for the realities of the world beyond.

As they progress through the program, students like Maya and Jacob develop essential skills that will serve them well in conventional schools: critical thinking; problem-solving, and social intelligence. These abilities are not just for educational success but for life beyond academics, helping them navigate the complexities of the modern world.

Jacob's mom, Laura, states, “He's discovered how to plan his day. It's not like he's simply doing whatever he desires. Jacob knows what he needs to accomplish, and he has to figure out how to make it happen. Yes, he has a weekly work plan, but he also keeps a journal of what he's done and puts together portfolios of his finest work. Like the majority of kids, Jacob doesn't constantly tell us about what he's performed in school unless it is something very amazing. However, he has so much to say at conference time or when

In Montessori classrooms, children of different ages interact, fostering a collaborative environment where older trainees coach more youthful ones. This mixed-age grouping helps children like Maya and Jacob establish social maturity and leadership abilities. It's an experience that's hard to replicate in standard schools but one that offers Montessori trainees an edge when it pertains to browsing new social environments.

“It's incredible to observe how they handle group work,” their Montessori instructor, Claire, says. “They're not simply trying to get things done rapidly; they're focused on finding out together. That collaboration constructs a lot of emotional intelligence.”

Jacob, who will probably transition to a standard middle school after sixth grade, is currently revealing indications of being ready for the modification. His self-confidence in handling his time and overcoming problems without fear of failure will be crucial as he moves into a more traditional environment.

Montessori Graduates in High School

Many Montessori parents question how their children will adapt from the Montessori approach to a more structured standard class setting. The experiences of former Montessori students, who efficiently transitioned from Montessori to conventional high schools, demonstrate the value of Montessori education in equipping trainees for the needs of standard academic environments.

Sophie, who is now a junior at a competitive private high school, recalls how her Montessori background offered her an unanticipated advantage when she started ninth grade. “At first, I fretted about all the tests and deadlines,” she states. “But honestly, it wasn't as hard as I thought it would be. I was currently used to handling my own time.”

Sophie gained valuable time management abilities in Montessori, which enabled her to organize her everyday jobs and schoolwork separately. This capability served her well when she started high school, as she adapted to the more strenuous schedule without feeling overwhelmed.

Unlike many of her brand-new schoolmates, Sophie felt confident in staying up to date with her work, attributing her success to the skills she obtained in Montessori.

Sophie's mother, Jen, who initially stressed over the shift to high school, now feels the strong foundation Montessori offered. She appreciates Sophie's resilience, capability to express concerns, and desire to take risks in her educational journey.

Daniel, a sophomore at a public high school, tells a comparable story. “In Montessori, you're taught to think for yourself, not simply follow guidelines,” he stated. “That actually assisted me when I got to high school. I wasn't scared to speak out in class or deal with jobs.”

Throughout his time at Montessori, Daniel participated in all sorts of creative activities that improved his ability to think critically and resolve problems. These qualities served him well in his new school's more structured environment. “I believe Montessori made me more positive,” he says. “It taught me how to figure things out on my own, which is something I see some of my friends fight with.”

His mom, Lisa, concurs. "He's not just going through the movements," she says. “Montessori gave him the tools to really engage with what he's learning, which's carried over into high school.”

The Long-Term Impact of Montessori

Maya and Jacob’s years in elementary Montessori are setting them up for success. They are learning to think deeply, work independently, solve problems, and make friends.

For graduates like Sophie and Daniel, the shift to traditional schools has been less of a hurdle and more of an opportunity to apply the skills they've spent years developing.

As Sophie prepares for college, she's optimistic that her Montessori background will continue to serve her well. “I don't just remember stuff for tests,” she says. “I know how to study and learn. That's what Montessori offered me.”

For parents like Jen and Lisa, the question of whether Montessori prepares children for traditional schools is clear. “Montessori isn't just preparing them for the next grade,” Lisa states. “It's not just about getting them ready for the next level. It's about providing the abilities and values they require to be successful in life.”

The same can be said for Maya, Jacob, Sophie, and Daniel. Whether they are building Roman aqueducts, computing the area of an intricate shape, or tackling the difficulties of high school, Montessori has actually provided a structure that goes far beyond academics — it's provided the ability to navigate whatever comes next. 

    content: `Education is often thought of as touching the future. The future is that place that is always outside of our grasp—a day or two or a decade away.

We touch the now.

The child, the parent, the educator, the community member, the international friend … we want to intentionally embrace the human in front of us now.

With this in the front of our minds, we believe that we can contribute significantly to a better world. This is our mission. Our mission is the now.

Our now is installing a child’s operating system. It is the core of who they are now and how they will proceed and process their future world. They are creating their default system to be full of warmth, wonder, abundance, and opportunity.

It is only during childhood that we can make this happen.

Choosing what is right in the present moment will create a better world.

Being open to taste something new and savor the pleasure of a new ritual and culture in the now opens pathways for the future.

Learning to mentor and give back now prepares us for new opportunities.

Learning to be mentored pushes us forward.

We are Pines Montessori School, an IMC-accredited family community of children 6 weeks to 15 years of age. With over 50 faculty members, 21 Montessori credentialed teachers (whose average tenure is 12 years), 260 children and over 500 fun, faithful, and brave Montessori parents. We have served Kingwood, Texas, and our surrounding community for 47 years.

This year we planted native Texas wildflowers in front of our school. These gorgeous flowers bloomed into many different varieties that grew in the community, complementing each other without ever losing their individuality. They live in the now. They are with us for a season and will leave us, but they will reseed us for years and generations to come. The work of Dr. Montessori and the work of Pines and the work of your school is no different.

As we move into our fifth decade we are building our very first new construction: a two-story, lower and upper elementary building now. We are Pines Montessori School! `,

A Salmon for Simon

Written by Betty Waterton

Illustrated by Ann Blades

This story is set in a little sea town on the western shore of Canada. It’s about a young boy who finds himself in an uncomfortable position, where he has to choose between his desire to catch a salmon or to save the life of this amazing animal. The illustrations are gorgeous and the text is smooth, engaging, and full of interesting things about the salmon and the sea life. Children 5 to 8 years old will enjoy the story and would love to engage in thinking and talking about why Simon decided to help the salmon back to the sea.

Backyard Birding for Kids: A Field Guide & Activities

Written & Illustrated by Fran Lee

This is a great little paperback book for grownups and children to read and do activities together. It includes all different environments: urban; suburban; rural; sea shores; mountains; prairies; warm; temperate; or cold. There's lots of good information for children about birds and their habitats, as well as activities that children can do to attract birds, to understand birds, and to appreciate and support bird life.

With the help of adults, children from 5-9 years old could become engaged in learning about these wonderful animals.

Meeting Natives with Lewis and Clark

Written by Barbara Fifer

I can remember as a late elementary/ early middle school child being fascinated by Native Americans: their lives, homes, food, music, beliefs, etc. This book reminds me of the kinds of books I devoured back then. Barbara Fifer seems to have done her homework on this one. The photos and illustrations are documented. Quotations are from the Journals of the Lewis and Clark Expedition.

She introduces each tribe of native Americans as Lewis and Clark traveled for three long years across what is now the USA. I would recommend this book as a resource for Upper Elementary as well as Middle School classrooms as Book they study our country’s history. I would also encourage parents and caregivers to add this book to their home library. It can be purchased online.

Teaching Montessori Science: 9 Practical Strategies to Engage Children in Hands-on STEAM Activities

Written by Jackie Grundberg

Wow! What an amazing tool for teachers, parents, and caregivers alike. The author has put together a combination of learning experiences designed with adults and elementary children in mind for school or home. The book is well illustrated, the content is backed up by current research, and the principles are Montessori-based. There couldn’t be a better combination.

Even if you only read the first chapter (which I am not suggesting), “The Benefits of Hands-on, Interactive Science Lessons,” you will gain a better understanding of the purpose of the book and will already have multiple examples of (and instructions for) science activities to do with children. However, I would not recommend that because you will be missing out on all the rest of the other great lessons in this book. You will definitely want to add this book to your teachers’ resources at schools or in your home resource center for homeschoolers.

The Camping Trip

Written by Jennifer K. Mann

Ernestine was so lucky to be invited to go on her first-ever camping trip with her Aunt Jackie and cousin Samantha. Her dad helped get all the things on Aunt Jackie’s list. They even made trail mix granola together.

As they drove out of the city, Ernestine hoped her dad wouldn’t miss her too much. They had lots of adventures with swimming, hiking, sleeping in a tent, food — nothing was like what she was used to at home. The illustrations are terrific — sort of like pages from a comic book. Turns out, Ernestine loved her trip even though she was a bit reticent at first. When she arrived home her dad gave her a big hug. She thinks that he missed her. It ends with her and her dad walking away and Ernestine asking him, “Have you ever tried s’mores?”

Wonderful book about trying new things even though they may be different from what we’re used to and having a great time! I suggest that children 5-9 years old would love this book.

That’s what this project is all about. You and your child can make colorful bowls from yarn scraps to give during the holiday season. Try the following steps and see how easy it is.

Materials:

• cornstarch paste

• yarn scraps

• plastic wrap, and

• a bowl to use as a form

Making the paste:

• 1/4 cup cornstarch

• 1/4 cup of cold water

• 1 cup hot water

• A small saucepan

Directions:

 

 

3. Dip the yarn in the paste. Layer the saturated yarn over the frame until completely covered.

 

 

 

 

 

4. Allow to dry for several days. When hardened, gently remove from the frame.

 

 

 

1. Mix the starch with cold water in a small saucepan to make a smooth paste. Add hot water, stirring constantly, cook until it thickens. Remove from heat. Cool before using. (How much adult help and supervision with this part depends on the child’s age and experience.)

2. Cover the outside of the bowl frame with plastic wrap.

 

 

 

Drum roll, please! Ta Da! Now your child has something they have made to give to someone special, who will most likely cherish it. 

    content: `by Collin Carpino, NewGate Class of 2024

What do Africa, the Cayman Islands, Florida, Georgia, Maine, Prince Edward Island, Spain, Virginia, and Wisconsin have in common? Well, for me, this is the community that makes up my high school. I am a recent Montessori graduate from the Global Campus of NewGate School, the Lab School of the Montessori Foundation. In this environment, I spent my weekdays with teachers and classmates spanning the globe, each bringing his or her unique viewpoints to hands-on, collaborative projects, research, and community discussions. When I tell people I went to high school online, I am often met with an unenthusiastic response, although I feel quite enthusiastic about this untraditional path.

NewGate Global is a real-time, online campus branch of NewGate School in Sarasota, Florida. Although NewGate has been around for 40 years, the Global campus emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic, when many schools were forced to close their doors and go virtual. Many families that desired a Montessori experience for their adolescent children found the program to be a vibrant eLearning community.

Each Global school day starts with an opening meeting in which all students (ages 12-18) are present, along with at least two teachers. It is a time to acknowledge everyone, say good morning, and sometimes even celebrate birthdays. We also talk about our daily phenology* recordings in which we go outside to a special place and observe how the environment changes within each season. On Mondays, we always share highlights from the weekend. On Tuesdays, a country is spotlighted, and then on Wednesdays, that country’s culture and traditions are discussed. Thursdays are our student-facilitated Council meetings in which questions and concerns are proposed to the community; future events are mentioned; our World Walking project is updated; our Global Journal is discussed; and we always close with personal gratitude. Council is a time to strengthen our community. Sometimes, we meet with the in-person Sarasota campus to discuss a book or film. On Fridays, we share special interests.

Traditional Montessori Secondary classes are typically divided into three cycles. We have two: Grades 7-9 and Grades 10-12. Students meet throughout the week with their assigned cycle for literature and composition, the humanities, the sciences, mathematics, and Spanish classes. Occasionally, a student from Cycle 1 may need to be in a mathematics class in Cycle 2 because he/she needs a more advanced class. Our students study mathematics from pre-algebra through calculus. We are also held accountable each week for time spent in creativity, action, and service (CAS) via an ongoing portfolio project that continues from year to year, and students are involved each year in a weeklong internship, which is then brought back to the community and shared. Opportunities and events on the brick-and-mortar Sarasota (FL) campus are always extended to the Global campus, such as Drama Immersion Week, during which students are responsible for all aspects of the production of a well-known play and participation in the annual Through Women’s Eyes Film Festival in Sarasota.

Every aspect of NewGate Global is interactive, engaging, fun, and collaborative. Students are encouraged to eat lunch together one day a week and to attend CAS Art after school on Thursdays for an teacher-hosted interactive art experience. As a Montessori student, I never once dreaded going to class. Some of my favorite activities included building model bridges, a to-scale model of the Parthenon, a solar-powered oven, an insulated house, and homemade bread. I have loved reading and studying Ishmael by Daniel Quinn; Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse; and The Pearl by John Steinbeck. We look very closely at historical events. Some of my favorites: Lewis Hine’s artwork of the Progressive Era; the Dust Bowl of the 1930s; the Cold War; and Global Politics. In environmental science, I especially enjoyed the many projects created throughout the year in which we looked at the natural world and our footprint on it.

The most unexpected aspect of NewGate Global is the strong sense of community that is easily observed throughout the school day and in special events, such as the Global Showcase (held in winter and spring). In the past, students have shared their interests outside of the classroom, which have included: dance; athletics; theater; playing instruments; singing; photography; artwork; flying a plane; ocean conservation; sewing historically accurate clothing; needlework; green projects; poetry; and writing. One recent graduate even shared his experience as an American Ninja Warrior finalist, and another shared his sculptures on display for Carnival Cruise Line. The focus of these events is not to have a winner but to have a variety show that highlights talents and interests of our community.

At the end of the 2023 school year, the NewGate Global community met in person for the first time in Sarasota. It was our first global gathering, and it was both amazing as well as surprising to see each other in real life. The only downside to the event was that it was just too short. At the end of this last school year, we had our second global gathering on Prince Edward Island (PEI) at the Canadian Centre for Climate Change and Adaptation. We participated in a research project with the University of PEI and celebrated collaborative efforts to become a Peace Certified School through the Mattie Stepanek Foundation.

    content: `Editor’s note: Montessori education is all about modeling the behavior we expect our children to learn. As they grow, we might not teach them how to wait for their turn to speak, but we might very well enforce their empathy, social skills and model the way we want them to think and reflect when something happens and they arrive late.

These suggestions can be applied with friends and family members. Children often want an explanation for your behavior. In this case, make a very short explanation. Children often want to be reassured that you aren’t angry with them and that you still love them.

Being more interested in their feelings than your own feelings is the key to a successful, powerful, and meaningful apology.

It is virtually impossible not to find yourself in this position. We hope that using these guidelines will help restore and enhance your relationship rather than create even more distance.

Don’t gaslight (making the other person question their reality).

“You must have heard me wrong. I said one-ish.” Comments like these put the responsibility for your actions on someone else.

Don’t put the blame on them.

“You should have called me if you were worried.”

Don’t make excuses for your behavior.

“My last appointment ran over time.” They are not interested in your excuses at this moment!

Don’t talk about how you feel.

“I am so embarrassed. I am usually on time.” Again, they are not interested in your feelings at this moment!

Don’t over apologize. “I am REALLY sorry. This was so inconsiderate of me.” This can be misconstrued as being more concerned about making sure they are not angry with you than you are about their feelings.

Don’t make false promises. “I promise I'll never be late again.” It is impossible to make this promise in the future, and it doesn’t alleviate the other person’s negative feelings.

Do take responsibility for your actions.

“You are right. I am REALLY late!”

Do validate their feelings.

“You have a right to be irritated with me.”

Do admit you were wrong.

“I didn’t watch my time effectively.”

Do empathize with how they might be feeling. “It must have been irritating to wait this long.”

Do sincerely apologize once, while making good eye contact with them.

Do make amends for your behavior.

“How about I buy your lunch for inconveniencing you?”

Montessori education embraces the whole child to create a nourishing environment that fosters curiosity, creativity, connection to the natural world, and respect for the earth. Encouraging healthy eating and caring for our bodies is part of the philosophy, but how do we integrate these practices into our daily lives? How do we inspire children throughout their early years and beyond to develop healthy habits and food preferences that will remain stable for life?

From infants all the way through high school, healthy eating and wellness are not only an integral part of the curriculum but interwoven into daily life at Desert Garden Montessori (Phoenix, AZ). Each morning, as the sun rises and the school begins to come alive, a wooden farm cart in the center of campus is stocked with baskets and jars containing daily whole-food snacks. Students from each classroom bring reusable bags to select a wholesome homemade snack that always includes fresh, seasonal, locally grown produce.

Today’s snack is Cinnamon and Maple-Seed Granola with Oat Milk and Ana Apples. The harvest, along with nutrition information about ingredients, is brought back to the classroom to be prepared mindfully and shared with each child. In the infant room, Ms. Kinnari printed photos of oats, pumpkin seeds, and apples and clipped them to the wall next to the snack table so that the babies could begin to be introduced to the whole foods in today’s snack. This simple process builds a foundation that helps children develop intuitive, healthy eating from an early age.

Just past the Wellness Garden Market, towards the end of campus, Chef Val and her small team are getting an early start preparing lunch in the organic kitchen, where nutritious meals are made from scratch and shared with love each day. Like the snacks, lunches are centered around whole, seasonal ingredients. This month, Chef Val is highlighting lentils, quinoa, Brussel sprouts, and dill. These seasonal ingredients are superstars that will appear in new and creative ways throughout the month in dishes like Lentil Mujadara, Balsamic Glazed Brussel Sprouts, Garden Salad with Cucumber Dill Dressing, and Quinoa Fried Rice.

Behind the kitchen, a greenhouse is nestled underneath velvet mesquite trees, where some of the herbs and greens used in the organic lunch are grown. From seed to table, this is where children of all ages care for their garden as well as harvest, prepare, and eat the produce. Inside the greenhouse, fresh herbs, leafy greens, edible flowers, and vegetables are grown using vertical tower gardens. Tower gardens are aeroponic systems that can produce year-round in a variety of spaces. They use 95 percent less water and grow much faster than traditional gardening, making them ideal for small urban settings.

This week in wellness class, primary and lower elementary students are learning about whole grains. The children start by gathering in a circle in the grass, where they are introduced to the lesson with glass jars containing a variety of whole grains: brown rice, millet, quinoa, barley, amaranth, and oats. They learn that grains are the seeds of grasses,and seeds have the power to nourish our entire body and bring the earth to life. The lesson helps children understand the difference between whole and refined grains by sharing that when a grain is processed, some of the layers (and valuable nutrients) are  removed.

After circle time, children wash their hands and move to the Tasting Table, where plant-based chef and holistic nutrition educator Cassie Tolman presents a lesson on making Brown Rice and Millet Onigiri. Each child rolls cooked brown rice and millet into a ball, makes a ‘nest’ in the center, and then fills it with edamame and colorful veggies. They form their Onigiri back into a ball and roll it in toasted sesame seeds. Now it is time to enjoy our Brown Rice and Millet Onigiri! Many children raise their hands, asking for seconds and thirds.

Once the Onigiri have been enjoyed, they move to the Eco Exploration Table, where they learn about the calming power of herbs, while making Grain & Lavender Sachets with Montessori-certified teacher and tower gardener Chelsey James. Dried chamomile flowers, harvested from our greenhouse, are blended with brown rice and a few drops of relaxing lavender oil. The children take deep breaths and relax, pouring the blend into cloth bags and wrapping them with twine to take home. Later that afternoon, older students will work in smaller groups, learning how to grow, prepare, and eat real living foods from the earth. In the greenhouse, Ms. Chelsey teaches aeroponic gardening while Ms. Cassie collaborates with students in the organic kitchen to develop healthy recipes for a soon-to-be-published cookbook. These activities represent a snapshot of a single week in Wellness Education at Desert Garden Montessori. Other lessons in the holistic curriculum include: Embracing the Whole-Foods Rainbow; What is Taste? What is Flavor?; Eating with the Seasons.

All Food Has a Story; Seeds We Eat & Plant; Legumes (Celebrating Squash); Corn (an Ancient Staple); Winter Solstice: Nourishing our Immune System; Microbiome (Caring for our Inner Garden); Mindful Eating & Joyful Movement; and more.

The Wellness Education Program at Desert Garden Montessori provides hands-on experiences that connect students to food, their bodies, the Earth, and each other. This holistic curriculum offers students experiential learning opportunities to facilitate culinary literacy and gardening, deepen their relationship with food, and develop agency to create wellness in their own lives and their communities.

Rooted in the belief that children will only learn healthy habits if they are practicing them every day, the core pillars of this program are:

• Gardening: Growing our own food increases access to fresh, nutrient-dense food, builds a connection to the Earth, and creates a living classroom.

• Embracing the Whole-Foods Rainbow: Whole foods work synergistically to supply all of nature’s nutrients in a perfect package, providing us with vital life-force energy.

• Cooking: We prepare nutritious, healthy foods with (and for) our children. By doing, one learns.

• Supporting Local: We support local farmers by purchasing and serving organic, seasonal, locally grown foods at our school.

• Replenishing the Earth: Our daily lives replenish the earth for future generations. We apply the 5 R’s: Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, and Rot through our Food-toFood Compost Program and by reusing materials that might otherwise be sent to the landfill.

• Nourishing the Whole Child: We nourish the whole child (mind, body, and spirit) with natural, unprocessed foods and integrative health practices. We also teach about the world's interconnectedness.

Inviting children into the kitchen, engaging their senses with fresh, seasonal, delicious ingredients, and creating positive food experiences can be incorporated at home. Making space to integrate small practices into each day has the power to create a ripple effect in your family’s life. Start small by planting an herb garden, shopping for weekly groceries at your local farmer’s market, volunteering at a community garden, or trying a new recipe centered around whole foods. Take it slow and at a pace that works for you and your family. A healthy lifestyle is not about perfection but about the continuum of healthy living. We hope this article has inspired you to cultivate joyful wellness in your home. 

    content: `Parents & Adult Montessori Children

The sun shone on the gleaming wooden boxes, the healthy plants, and the happy rabbit living quietly in the corner as I followed my daughter into a Montessori classroom for the first time. I had searched the Phoenix Valley for a place for my two-year-old to spend the mornings while I worked on my master’s degree. The daycares I visited were loud, smelly, and unnerving with the constant sound of crying. Then, just like in the folk story, I found just what I had been looking for, practically in my own backyard. Rainbow Montessori School was housed in a ranch-style house with a large patio, where children were welcome to work at any time. There were glass plates on the snack shelf, enticing materials in each room, and peaceful adults helping when needed. I observed a class and couldn’t wait for my daughter to start. The teacher would bring her out to the car line each day and say something like, “Lina worked on the color boxes today.” “The color boxes? What are the color boxes?” I needed to know.

From then, I became the nosey parent, always asking what was in the boxes and what did they do? I came to every parent night and couldn’t get enough of this Montessori thing. We had since moved to Utah and immediately enrolled Lina in a Montessori school there, continuing my questioning of every little thing. One day the director of the school asked why I didn’t take the training. “Oh, no. I’m not a teacher. I’m a scientist,” I said. But I started to think about it. I read a little of Dr. Montessori’s work and realized she was a scientist, too.

Decades later both of my children, and now their children, have been through our school. Lina and Leith both did well in college, pursued careers in areas far removed from education, but came back to our school to teach and to lead. They are happy, successful adults who enjoy their days, no matter what they are doing. They have always been good at academics; they read a lot; they are interested in many things and never stop learning. They are students of life. But as a parent, I would say that the most important thing they got from their Montessori years was that sense of mindfulness, of purpose, of knowing how to solve a problem, of acting independently and confidently, of enjoying every moment.

I recently attended the International Montessori Congress in Bangkok, where a group of Montessori adolescents spoke. This presentation came at the end of the conference after many adult presenters spoke of the trying times in our world today. One of the adolescents concluded her presentation by saying that she listened to what the adults had been saying and just wanted to reply, “We’ve got this.” 

    content: `A School that Lives Its Mission and Core Values

Bridgeview Montessori is a 10,000 sq. ft. school designed for 95 students. It has six classrooms, a dedicated art studio, a science room, a library, a kitchen, a separate space for before-and-after-care, and small conference rooms. The school sits on 1.25 acres along the Cape Cod Canal in Sagamore, Massachusetts and has a Children’s House and Lower and Upper Elementary classes.

When families walk through the doors at Bridgeview Montessori, they feel the many hands that have created the scaffolding that allows children to grow towards being authentic human beings with confidence, integrity, and grit. Families blossom into a community with shared responsibility, loyalty, and trust. It is palpable.

The school was founded by parents who wanted an inspired Montessori education for their children. Jean Rice and Palmer True had witnessed the power of Maria Montessori’s pedagogy when their twin sons were in a local Montessori Children’s House, but when the boys were ready for their Elementary years, no option existed in their Cape Cod or South Coast Massachusetts community. Thus, in 1999, Bridgeview Montessori came to be.

WE CULTIVATE CREATIVE PROCESS · WE GROW EMPOWERED AND RESILIENT PEOPLE · WE HOLD COMMUNITY CLOSE

In those early years, the school grappled a bit with their identity, wondering if a Montessori Elementary school could thrive in a community in which public school was the norm. Yet, those visionaries never questioned the school’s importance in providing something essential for the community. They imagined a school where many different types of learners could feel inspired, be authentic, build confidence, have a voice, learn peacefully side by side, actively listen, and appreciate quiet.

In 2007, Palmer and his wife realized that in order to guarantee the longevity of their wonderful school and to ensure that it maintained their original vision of Montessori Elementary, the school needed to be a non-profit independent school run by a board of trustees.

Palmer encouraged those passionate about the school to change its status to that of a not-for-profit organization. After eight months of hard work, the school’s design team (made up of parents; faculty, outside educators, and community members) created and filed the charter and documentation to gain 501(c)(3) status. This important piece of the school’s history speaks to the passion, dedication, wisdom, perseverance, and good ol’ grit that pervades Bridgeview Montessori’s classrooms, outdoor learning spaces, offices, and parking lot with our families and caregivers! Having first leased the building and property, the board was eventually able to secure the financing to purchase the building and property from Palmer.

Bridgeview’s teachers are Montessori-trained educators who have dedicated their professional lives to guiding students to be the best they can be academically, socially, and emotionally. They collaborate with each other; they actively seek professional development; and they strive to create a family/school partnership for each individual upon entering our classrooms. The administrative team is small by design, consisting only of the Head of School; Director of Children’s House; Assistant Head of School/Director of Admissions; and Administrative Coordinator. Decision making is collaborative and, in keeping with its stated core value, Inspire Every Voice. The teachers and specialists are autonomous yet actively collaborate with (and learn from) each other. They have over 50 years of collective work experience at Bridgeview Montessori.

Bridgeview Montessori has working parents, military parents, single parents, foster parents, grandparents raising their grandchildren, and LGBTQI parents. Some parents apply for and receive financial aid; some parents pay full tuition. Some parents are familiar with independent school culture and Montessori specifically; some are new to Montessori and to private school. Some families choose to keep their children at Bridgeview from 2.9 through 12 years old; some are only there for preschool; and some come to us after having been disappointed with the traditional schooling provided by their towns. These varied backgrounds and experiences add to the richness of the school community.

Central to this vibrant community are its students. Each individual who walks through the doors does so with the raw material needed to implant, grow, and blossom. That student may be a math wizard, a dinosaur fan, an avid reader, or a soon-to-be toilet trained two-year-old. In any case, these students learn what they are good at. They become emboldened, inspired, and independent.

In a society where childhood can be rushed, technology is everywhere, and frenetic schedules are more the norm than the anomaly, Bridgeview Montessori is vital for those families and educators searching for that safe port in the storm. It is an environment where everyone feels safe to do their best work and safe to share those growing edges. Bridgeview Montessori’s growth and longevity is that of the collective. 

Suzanne Lawson, Assistant Head of School / Director of Admissions, joined the faculty at Bridgeview Montessori in 2008 after spending several years raising her two children. Prior to that time, Suzanne had spent many years in teaching, curriculum development, and faculty development in independent boarding and day schools, most recently at the Shady Hill School in Cambridge. She is very familiar with Montessori education, having been a Montessori student herself from age 3 through the 5th grade at the Whitby School in Greenwich, Connecticut. Her children also attended Bridgeview Montessori, each for seven years. With their strong Montessori foundation, her children are both thriving in Vermont colleges (Middlebury and UVM). Suzanne holds a BA in English from Northwestern University as well as a MA in teaching English from Columbia University Teachers College. She is the Kindergarten Librarian and also manages our marketing and outreach. When not at school, Suzanne can be found doing barn chores and riding horses.`,

DEAR CATHIE— MY DAUGHTER LOVES PLAYING IN HER COUSIN’S PLAY KITCHEN. WHENEVER WE ARE AT HER COUSIN'S HOUSE, SHE GRAVITATES TOWARD THAT ACTIVITY AND SPENDS A LOT OF TIME THERE. WE HAVE VISITED QUITE A FEW MONTESSORI PROGRAMS, AND WE NOTICE THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE A PLAY COOKING AREA. WE THOUGHT THE MONTESSORI METHOD ENCOURAGED CHILDREN TO DO THINGS THEY WERE INTERESTED IN. WHY DON’T MONTESSORI CLASSROOMS HAVE PLAY KITCHENS?

— PUZZLED PARENTS

 

Dear Parents,

You are very observant on two counts! Children (even very young children) are naturally drawn to the activities that happen in the kitchen and those that surround eating and cooking. They love to do the things that they see their parents, older siblings, and caregivers do. They are called to be a part of the community happenings surrounding snacks, meals, and food preparation.

Montessori classrooms do not have these activities in play form in their environments. Dr. Maria Montessori noticed that, when given the choice, children were not interested in playing about food preparation. What they were really seeking was real-life experience surrounding food preparation, serving, and cleaning up. They wanted to do the things that adults do with genuine utensils—but the right size for their hands. The Montessori environment does just that. The typical Montessori classroom provides experiences in authentic life activities, such as pouring water from a pitcher for your own snack or serving yourself crackers from a communal bowl. A child as young as two or three is serving himself food when he is hungry and cleaning up after himself when he is finished. He might also be involved in setting up the lunch for the entire class, putting out placemats, silverware, plates, and glasses. This helps the classroom operate much like a real family, practicing manners and grace and courtesy skills daily.

Children have experiences preparing their own snack. They might spread butter on toast, make their own fruit salad (by counting out three pieces of apple, two pieces of pear, and one grape that they cut in half themselves) or dip three chips in salsa.

The shelf contains self-selected activities that develop these skills at different levels. Children learn to pour from one vessel to another. Later they practice pouring up to a line as they will need to do when they are measuring wet ingredients. They might have an exercise pouring from a pitcher into four glasses, as if they were serving four friends. As the skill level of the class grows, the offerings on the shelves change and the skill level of the entire class grows. These skills come together in real cooking experiences in the classroom.

Children are shown how to do the things that adults do by breaking the tasks down into small steps and practicing each step until it is mastered. Adults in the environment provide tasks that are appropriate for each child’s development. For example, a class might make tomato soup. Younger students might mash one whole canned tomato. Older students might cut the fresh seasoning into small pieces with scissors. A child might cut the bread into squares to make croutons. Others will grate the parmesan cheese. Some children will toss the croutons in the olive oil and in the grated cheese. Using tongs, they will carefully lift each crouton and place it on the cookie sheet where it will toast. The adult will mix the soup using the infusion blender, as that part is too sophisticated for a child. Later, they will add vegetable broth and a small amount of pasta to the soup. (In one class they added whipped cream that the children shook themselves and did not add the pasta.) For snack, the children had tomato soup, ladled out by the child and topped with croutons (counted out by the child). The completion of this exercise provides each child with the pride of accomplishment, as well as the completed product.

Montessori classrooms provide real-life experiences for children to do Practical Life exercises. They do not have any play kitchens or pretend toys. Rather, we have real exercises that practice real skills. These build on each other to help children learn to do more and more complicated sequences of skills, such as baking.

I hope this helps clarify the difference between playing with cooking toys one might see in a home playroom and having real Practical Life and cooking experiences that are a part of the Montessori classroom experience. 

    content: `A Journey of Discovery & Connection

by Ola Elserwi

The ancient Greeks regarded drawing geometric constructions using only a compass and straightedge as essential for proving theorems. They discovered that this method facilitated problem analysis through the figures created, leading to solutions.

Throughout my educational journey, I stood out as the geometry geek among my classmates. Teachers often praised my ability to grasp and navigate geometric concepts swiftly. Growing up with an engineer for a father, I was led to believe that my aptitude for engineering stemmed from his genes, which seemingly multiplied the geometry neurons in my brain.

For months, my classmates and I dedicated ourselves to memorizing formulas, theorems, and prescribed steps for writing proofs. We did all this without truly critiquing or comprehending the process or applying our knowledge to meaningful contexts. This left us continually asking the question: Why are we learning this? For many, geometry became synonymous with daunting complexity, evoking memories of classes filled with perplexing theorems and bewildering formulas. While memorization may have aided some in solving certain problems, it did little to demystify geometry or foster a genuine affinity for the subject.

When the time arrived to pass on my geometry knowledge to my daughter, who was more inclined towards nature, art, and social activities, I experienced resistance. Her school's emphasis on rote memorization caused her to develop a fear of geometry, along with the belief that she was prone to making mistakes, which led her to find geometry difficult and boring. Despite my confidence, my attempts to assist her with personally tested tools, as well as hiring a geometry tutor, yielded tenuous results. As I wondered how to proceed, I questioned whether she would intuit concepts in geometry as effortlessly as I had, given our shared genetic makeup. However, her journey with geometry diverged from mine, marking a significant turning point for me.

In our three-dimensional, ever-changing world, children naturally develop a significant reservoir of geometric knowledge, which Montessori referred to as engrams. The geometry curriculum should harness this intuitive understanding to enhance and formalize students' foundational knowledge. Presenting geometry solely as a standalone, content-driven subject in a linear fashion, with time constraints and a rigid set of standards to cover, promotes premature abstraction. This approach can dampen students' enthusiasm and deprive them of the opportunity for self-paced exploration and a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of life. Abstraction also severs the connection between geometry and its presence in nature, art, and human-made structures.

 

 

 

 

 

There is nothing in the intellect which is not first in the senses. — Aristotle

To facilitate a smooth transition to sensible abstraction, it is essential to 'scaffold' learners as they progress from simple to more complex levels of understanding, gradually shedding external support. This process involves building upon learners' existing knowledge to prepare them for new concepts. It necessitates a focus on enhancing learners' comprehension of geometric relationships, not because they lack the ability to grasp them but because they require immersive, qualitative, and hands-on experiences over time to develop critical thinking and visualization skills. This development occurs through reflection on actions, communication of observations and conclusions, and the cultivation of a robust vocabulary of geometric terms. In order to ensure that learners become confident and proficient, this approach must be integrated, dynamic, and tailored to leverage student culture, interests, language, available technology, manipulatives, and other resources.

Integrating geometry into our spiral curriculum cultivates interconnectedness across diverse learning domains, enabling children to explore its applications and forge meaningful connections between theoretical concepts and real-world experiences. By showcasing practical examples, such as architects utilizing circles to bolster structural resilience and environmental sustainability, plumbers determining offset angles to regulate fluid flow rates, and dentists employing angles for precise tool and material placement, students gain a deeper appreciation for the relevance of geometry in everyday life.

Tracing the historical evolution of geometric knowledge from practical applications to abstract theories reveals the contributions of various civilizations. The Greeks, for instance, developed theorems and proofs through structured

discussions that emphasized clear argumentation, giving rise to Greek Logic. However, the roots of geometry stretch back to ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, where practical applications flourished alongside agriculture, architecture, calendars, astronomy, and commerce, all facilitated by the presence of rivers. This progression prompted Aristotle to propose his peripatetic axiom, "There is nothing in the intellect which is not first in the senses," a concept later embraced by Montessori, who emphasized the integration of hands-on learning with intellectual pursuits.

 

 

 

 

By immersing students in the historical evolution of geometry, from practical applications to abstract concepts, we equip them with the skills to analyze and elucidate past challenges. This positions them to discern patterns in the contemporary landscape, thereby offering a vital perspective for comprehending and ultimately resolving present and future issues.

As I stepped into an Upper Elementary Montessori classroom, I was so excited about teaching geometry in a manner that enables and allows students (and me) to make discoveries through geometry's intrinsic cultural richness at different scales. Teaching geometry through its cultural lenses entails including diversity in anything that has to do with how people live, such as art, recreation, beliefs, languages, traditions, stories, and folklore, ways of organization, ways of interaction with the environment, and attitudes.

At the beginning of the year, I introduced the yin-yang design to my students, inviting them to share its story and significance. I found joy in hearing their narratives, and it gave them the opportunity to teach me. Yet, they needed more certainty regarding how to utilize a compass and straightedge to draw it. We analyzed the design, discussed each component, and then I guided them with some cues before stepping back to observe. What fascinated me was their dedication to perfecting and refining their personalized creations, as well as their "AHA" moments when they saw their ideas come to life, indicating their comprehension. Consequently, I adopted a construction-based learning approach throughout the year.

Thus, drawing comes to satisfy a need for expression, as does language; ...the effort to perfect such expression is very similar to that which the child makes when he is spurred on to perfect his language in order to see his thoughts translated into reality.

— Maria Montessori,

The Advanced Montessori Method, volume II, part V

Our exploration of geometric constructions extended to various cultures, including the Babylonians, Chinese, Indians, Islamics, Africans, Native Americans, Dutch, and numerous others. Delving into the narratives behind these constructions allowed my students to gain a profound insight into how our ancestors approached problems and persevered through trials, hardships, and triumphs to enrich the world. As they delved into their ancestors' contributions and stories related to geometry, my students found connections between themselves and their forebears, fostering a deeper appreciation for their cultural heritage.

I provided explicit instruction in construction techniques, covering the proper handling and use of a compass and straightedge, the angle and sharpness of pencils, types of leads, erasers, erasing techniques, hand placement, and cushioning under the paper. This equipped my students with the skills to think critically, visualize, critique, discover, conclude, and comprehend geometry concepts over time.

I vividly recall my students' fascination when I introduced certain constructions using only a compass and straightedge, such as the circumscribed circle of a square, finding the midpoint of a line, bisecting an angle, and doubling the borders of a hexagon. Some students were inspired to explore alternative techniques to execute these constructions beyond those I had taught. While this journey involved a considerable amount of trial and error, the joy and empowerment derived from their exploration and subsequent learning were evident. As I met with them to discuss their investigation, I also gained valuable insights.

In teaching geometric constructions, I offered multiple approaches and techniques to accommodate different learning styles. This ensured that students understood geometry as a field with a spectrum of ideas rather than a single solution. This approach encouraged my students to pursue their own research questions, develop innovative geometric designs, and delve into historical contexts.

 

Geometry transformed into a captivating treasure hunt as my students explored the intricate Islamic geometric constructions and admired the beauty of biomorphic art, also known as Arabesque, from various regions and eras. This journey fostered divergent thinking, creative problem-solving, and the development of logical reasoning skills among my students. They became deeply engaged in investigating, experimenting, and creating their own constructions, sharing the joy of discovery with one another. Through geometric constructions, they delved into spatial relationships, properties of geometric figures, transformations and modeling, measurement, and deductive reasoning. This immersive experience allowed them to perceive the world through a geometric lens, truly encountering geometry in their everyday lives. They met geometry!

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

During the editing process of this article, an interesting event occurred: One of my students approached me seeking guidance on drawing various types of bridges. This prompted me to initiate a study unit on the historical aspects of bridges. To scaffold their learning journey, students completed a KWL chart—a graphic organizer that assists students in arranging information prior to, during,

and following a unit or lesson, to express their background knowledge, interests, and inquiries regarding the topic. Among their curiosities were inquiries about the origins of bridges, their quantity, drawing techniques, construction methods, and materials utilized. Exploring these questions offers insight into their fascination with historical origins, pioneering figures, and the artistic aspects of design.

As I journey through the realms of geometry, my comprehension has matured, leading me to embrace a multidimensional approach to teaching that integrates language, art, history, and science with this discipline. Geometry serves as a unifying force, a universal language of expression that bridges diverse subjects and people together. It stands as a universal language capable of fostering peace and unity. Let us continue to delve into the cultural depth of geometry, recognizing its importance for humanity's collective understanding. 

Over a decade ago, Ola Elserwi embraced the calling to become a Montessori teacher, infusing her pedagogy with creativity and passion. Today, as an Upper Elementary Montessori educator, she harmonizes her love for teaching with artistic expression, Islamic geometric designs, and biomorphic patterns.

Her accomplishments are helping the creation of a pioneering Montessori Arabic language curriculum, adopted by schools across Egypt and beyond. In addition to academia, Ola finds solace in crafting intricate geometric designs, honoring her deep reverence for Islamic art and culture. When not shaping young minds or designing curriculum materials, she immerses herself in nature, traversing scenic landscapes, embracing physical activity, and exploring literature.`,

Jars of HOPE

Written by Jennifer Roy

Illustrated by Meg Owenson

These are two different books, written by two different women, creating two slightly different stories, but both are about the same courageous woman: Irena Sendler.

The setting is the beginning of WW II in the Warsaw Ghetto, Poland.

I am always saddened by stories about how unkind humans can be to one another. However, I am lifted up when reading stories of individuals (as well as groups of people) show unbelievable strength and courage in the face of horrific injustice and bias towards others. Irena Sendler and many others banded together for good and were able to rescue so many more Jewish children than any one person could have done on their own.

There is a very informative biography of Irena Sendler at the end of Irena’s Jars of Secrets. Both books include a glossary and pronunciation guide for readers. These books are amazing history books for children from about 11 through 13 or 14 years old. They can be purchased online.

Feast For Ten

Written by Cathryn Falwell

This is a wonderful counting book, wrapped around the story of a family

dinner. It reminded me of Sunday dinners at Gramma’s house when I was a child. It tells the story of a family meal from the grocery store to the dinner table. Counting all the way from 1-10, shopping at the store and then starting all over again with taking the food out of the car. It demonstrates how a family can happily work together to create a wonderful meal for everyone, all while counting the carrots, the bunches of greens, the cooks, the chairs, the plates, etc. Children will enjoy this fun book. It is available online.

 

What a Rock Can Reveal

Written by Maya Wei-Haas (a Montessori graduate)

Illustrated by Sonia Pulido

What a wonderful book for the Elementary years! Maya Wei-Haas knows just how to engage the curiosity of those inquisitive and imaginative minds. She is a Montessori school graduate, who

is now a scientist and writer. Her experience as a Montessori student, I am quite sure, influenced how she organized the book, providing easy-to-understand information. She answers many questions and offers many reallife examples and experiences.

Sonia Pulido’s illustrations are colorful and realistic, inclusive of the children and places around the world. She depicts the kinds of events referenced in the book (i.e., volcanoes, earthquakes, and tectonic plates).

I really didn't want to put this book down, and it’s relatively long, but that shouldn’t stop anyone from reading this captivating book. I would suggest that adults could easily divide the book into sections and do one at a time. As I read it, I was reminded of baking soda and vinegar volcanoes, rock tumblers for smoothing stones, telescopes for watching the night skies, caverns underground for visiting, and more. There could be all kinds of adventures and experiments to supplement the reading. I can’t wait for my almost 8-year-old grandson to visit so we can start looking at rocks and their stories. This is a book for home and school libraries for sure. It can be purchased at most bookstores online or in person.

 

Not Too Late:

Changing the Climate

Story from Despair to Possibility

Edited by Rebecca Solnit & Thelma Young Lutunatabua

This book is a collection of articles written by people from many different

organizations, occupations, and countries from around the world who are interested, knowledgeable, and committed to making change in our world. There can be no “pollyanna” or “pie-in-the-sky” thinking about the changes that have happened and continue to happen on earth. However, there is hope and resilience in humans across the globe. The articles in this book inform us about some of those humans, the actions they are taking, and the information gathered.

The importance of reading Not Too Late should not be underestimated or overlooked by anyone who has a child or who cares for children. All of us are being affected by reports of the state of the world that we see and hear every day. As adults, it’s our responsibility to help our children to develop resilience and hope even in challenging times. One way to do that is by reading this book. It will help bolster your resilience and hope. Through our attitudes and actions, children will absorb our renewed spirit and become empowered themselves. In this day and time, I suggest that this is a must read for parents, teachers, and all adults who influence children’s lives. It can be purchased online or in bookstores.

 

Pirate Ships and Shooting Stars

Written by Carolinda Goodman

Illustrated by Nur Efsan Topcu

Wow! This is a book that I had tucked away and found again the other day.

It turns out that I’ve had it for almost two years now. Anyway, today, I finally read it. It’s grand!

Carolinda wrote the text in rhyme, which young children love so much. It’s all about the sky and what we can see up there if we use our imaginations. There are pictures, stories, and even shows if we just take the time to look up and see. First the author looks at the sky during the day, starting with sunrise, then pictures in the clouds, sometimes rainbows, or clear skies open for our imaginations to soar! Later, of course, there’s the sunset, the moon and stars, constellations, shooting stars, and more.

I love the excitement and enthusiasm for watching the sky with all its wonders that the author brings to readers.`,

    content: `A GUIDE FOR PARENTS OF TODDLERS

As a parent, the transition from home to school can be a whirlwind of emotions. Excitement mingles with anxiety, and there's a mix of anticipation and uncertainty about how your child will fare in this new environment. But fear not; you're not alone in this journey. Whether it's tears of joy or trepidation, the experiences you're going through are valid, and there's support available to help ease the transition for both you and your child.

Based on a webinar hosted by Kathy Leitch, the Executive Director of the International Montessori Council (IMC), we want to share some insights and tips to make this transition smoother for everyone involved.

Do you have an infant or toddler at home who is getting ready to enter a Montessori program? Then this article is for you!

The Prepared Environment and How to Prepare Yourself

In Montessori, we often talk about the prepared environment, which is more than just the physical environment. The prepared environment also includes our personal environment and our attitude. Montessori training even includes a whole section on the Spiritual Preparation of the Teacher. While you don’t need to do that, it may help to do some introspection. The confidence parents display to children before they enter the classroom will help them prepare for what their experience will be.

Rest assured that parents often have mixed feelings about bringing their little one to school for the first time. We may be excited to give them an opportunity to meet other children and to have both educational stimulation and some socialization. The flip side of excitement is anxiety

about how they will adapt to the changes in their routines and environments. Will they separate easily? Will there be tears? We may even be concerned about shedding a tear ourselves. What will we do if that happens?

DO YOU HAVE AN INFANT OR TODDLER AT HOME WHO IS GETTING READY TO ENTER A MONTESSORI PROGRAM? THEN THIS ARTICLE IS FOR YOU!

Maybe you feel a little celebratory, thinking that you've made it to a particular milestone, or you've been on a waiting list at a Montessori school, and you finally have an opportunity to have your child join. Wherever you are in this range (or if you’re feeling all these at once), we are here to tell you that all feelings are valid, and it is only natural and healthy to feel them! One of the main things to remember is that the teachers and the school leaders have been through this before. They are there to support you and to help you and your child through this transition.

Start Building Your School Partnership

Speaking of learning about your school’s policies, you might want to learn about the protocols in advance. For example:

• How will your child be greeted?

• Where is the appropriate drop-off area?

• Are you expected to stay with your child, or is this the time that you will be leaving your child?

Get to know the protocols at your school because they may vary from others.

Attend Your Parent Orientation Meeting

A cornerstone of Montessori is the deep sense of community that is built within a classroom and how much a Montessori guide knows your child and your family. Communication in the first three years in a Montessori program is probably the single most important thing a school and a family can do. The parent orientation meeting is the perfect opportunity to ask all your questions and learn more about the daily schedule. It is also where you can share a bit about your daily logistics and find some middle ground.

Parents can comfortably ask questions, and teachers can begin to understand and know each child’s needs and what they are trying to communicate, especially in our pre-verbal children. If you are a two-parent family, have both parents attend and take notes, because you'll hear part of it and your partner might hear part of it, and total retention of information is important.

 
TIP: If your toddler is going to be bringing a lunchbox to school, think about the entire process: Do they know how to open their lunchbox independently? How much support do they need? Are there containers inside that they can practice with at home prior to starting school? This will make them feel comfortable and familiar with the routines in the school day.

 

Expect Schedule Changes

You may also experience some regressions when the child first starts; the transition does not always go smoothly. At first, a child may be thrilled. Everything's fine, and then, two weeks later, it hits them: “Oh my gosh, did you mean I have to do this every day?” So, we want to be aware that it doesn't mean something bad happened. It doesn't mean that they can't come back to school. Stay calm, support them, keep that confidence, communicate with your child's teacher that you're getting some resistance, and they can help support you in that part of the transition. Usually within a week, two weeks, a month, most children will be having the best time of their lives and don't want to go home at the end of the day. So, just try and stick it out and stay positive.

Be aware about changes that may occur during those first six weeks before things start to settle. Your child’s appetite might dramatically change during the first days at school. Children may suddenly eat three times as much, or they may eat almost nothing because they're talking all through lunch with their new best friends. Nap times might change as well. While these are all changes, don’t panic. It will stabilize over time.

Some schools create several extra steps to ease families into the process. If you can, take advantage of those that work best for your family. Some of our favorites are:

Home Visits

A home visit is a way for your child and the teacher to begin to build trust and understanding at home, where your child feels comfortable and safe. The home visit will also help the teacher understand what the child is communicating, whether they’re hungry, or they need to move. We really get to learn what their cues are and how responsive we can be. Home visits allow children to meet their teachers in the comfort and familiarity of home with their parents. Home visits start the process of building trust and understanding between your child and the teacher. Home visits help make the transition from home to school easier for your child, the teacher, and you.

Moving to a new environment may be confusing, nonetheless. The younger the child is, the more confusing it might be for them. However, if the school and the home can stick to almost the same routines, children will have some consistency, and that will help them feel more comfortable. Bear in mind that life is full of change; children will learn to adjust. Routines will change, weekends will be different, grandparents might visit, and consistency helps to smooth the way.

Phase-In Programs

Phasing into a new program often helps children to gradually adjust to their new environment. Phase-in visits generally consist of starting with maybe just an hour visit with the parent present. If it's a new school year, you might have a few new students come together at a time with their parent to visit for about an hour.

They will get familiar with the environment and with the teacher and other caregivers. Subsequently, the teacher would periodically increase the amount of time they come to school each day. They might come for a half day and, if possible, the parent would leave for a short period of time. This starts conveying the message to the child that, yes, my parent will come back for me.

The main goal for this is to build the trust that these adults are okay, the environment is safe, and your parent will come back to get you. A phase-in process can take anywhere from about three days up to two weeks for some children. Sometimes, even if the school doesn’t provide this, certain children will insist on it. Some can't make it through the whole day. If this is the case, teachers may call their parents to set up a phase-in program, even if it's not a school-wide policy.

Some children are ready to go and they're the first ones in the door trying new things; whereas, some kids want to sit at the door and watch for a week, and that's valid.

Meet the Teacher and the Classroom

We love it when parents have the opportunity to observe the classroom environment, and we encourage you to pay special attention especially in these infant and toddler environments. Watch closely to see how the teacher responds to different needs or how they read the cues of these youngest students. Your child’s Montessori teacher will most likely give you signs to watch for and will help guide you so you know what to expect.

 

Sometimes, the teacher will suggest that the family bring a small stand-up frame containing a family picture with them to the teacher and parent meeting. This is an opportunity for the family and the child to talk about the picture. Then they find a special place for the picture on a counter or cabinet. Sometimes the child will just hold their picture. Holding the picture comforts, them; they are reassured that this is their family and that they are coming back for them. Children often go back to their family photo midyear and share it with their friends. The connection evolves as their language develops. It is not unusual for a teacher to overhear a child telling a story about their sibling, parent, guardian, grandparent, or whoever happens to be in the picture.

The Parent Handbook

The Parent Handbook is another source of information. Schools generally know the most frequently asked questions and seek to answer these in the handbook. The more familiar you are with the Parent Handbook, the more comfortable you're going to be with the process of what's happening.

Communicating with Your Child’s Teacher

Find out what your school's protocols are for contacting your teacher. Maybe there's a time after school when they can take/make phone calls. Perhaps you can email or use a particular communication system that your school has; if so, you will want to understand this process so that you feel comfortable.

Your school may have something like: Bright Wheel, Masori, Compass, Transform, or Transparent Classroom. These are wonderful ways to communicate daily, and your school will probably use one of these methods. Generally, the parents must accept an invitation to have access to the communication portal, so watch for that from your school. If your school doesn't have a formal communication method, don’t hesitate to make a few suggestions. Generally, the younger the child, the more communication you will receive. Communication will usually include informing you about how your child did during the day and what their schedule looked like that day (e.g., if they slept well or if they had any times when they were out of sorts).

 

Dismissal and arrival are not the times to ask questions; those are sacred interactions. When a parent is giving us their child for the day, we want to make that interaction as positive and as focused on the child as we possibly can. We always call that the “reunification time,” the time that parent and child are coming back together. To have adult conversations during those times really takes the child out of the process. We want to help support them.

 

Parent Ambassadors

It is great when you can ask for help from seasoned parents, who are eager to take new parents under their wings. This is always valuable, because schools are not just about the community of children; they are about the community of families as well. Often these interactions spark lifelong friendships. A benefit would be the possibility of getting a different parent perspective (not a different policy or procedure answer) but an alternative viewpoint. Perhaps it's a parent in their child’s classroom who's been there a little longer or has a child in the next level.

In Conclusion

You're taking a step into a big new world, and it's okay to have mixed feelings about that: be excited and scared and know that the people next to you with their kids coming in, feel the same way. We will all learn together. The teachers will learn about your children, and you will learn about the school. It becomes a new community every year; it's a wonderful thing. There may be bumps along the road, but there's a reason Montessori teachers do it for 20, 30, 40 years. It's because every year it becomes something bigger than just one person. It becomes a whole supportive community, and that is what makes it rather magical. 

    content: `A Practical Life Experience for Children 16 months and up

by Sarah Moudry

Materials you will need

• Towel bar

• Towel bar brackets

• 18” roll of paper meant for paint

• Contact paper (to protect the wall)

• Vinyl floor mat

• Wall clips

• Magnetic wall strip

• Magnetic container

• Paint cups

• Paint, brushes, chalk, crayons

• Child- and adult-sized aprons

Children love to paint and draw. Are you thinking of adding a painting easel in your home? Or are you frustrated with the amount of space an easel takes up in your house? Many of the easels designed for children are bright, garish in color, plastic, and oversized. Who wants that as a centerpiece in your family space?

Today, we want to share a sturdy, space-saving alternative to an art easel in your home. Children love to paint and draw. Giving them a large surface to do so allows for strength building, provides practice for arm and hand control, and is an open-ended creative exercise they will enjoy. Consider this new install we did at @thestudiojune for a possible art area in your home.

Designing the space

1. Place contact paper on the wall to protect the wall

2. Decide on the proper height of the paper for your child's height

3. Attach the towel bar at the top of this space

4. Attach the magnetic wall strip at the bottom of this space

5. Slide the paper roll onto the towel bar.

6. Thread the paper behind the magnetic wall strip and out the bottom

7. Attach the wall clips to the wall, where your child can reach and you would like their painting to dry

8. Attach the magnetic container to the magnetic wall strip

9. Prepare the paint in the cups

Sharing the Lesson

1. As with all Practical Life activities, show your child the tools you will need, what they are called, and how to hold them.

2. Remind your child that you will show them how to do the activity, and then they will have a turn.

3. Put on your aprons.

4. Choose a piece of paper.

5. Show your child how to clip the paper to the easel; this will depend on the type of clip and easel you have.

6. Open the paint container and place the lid in the tray of the easel.

7. Hold the paintbrush with a pencil grip.

8. Dip your brush in the paint.

9. Use the tip of the brush to make a stroke on the paper.

10. Look at your child and pause.

11. Dip the brush back in the paint.

12. Use a different edge of the brush to make a new stroke on the paper.

13. Repeat dipping the brush in the paint and holding the brush at a new angle to make a new mark.

14. Place the brush in the tray.

15. Close the container of paint.

16. Invite your child to have a turn.

17. Remove the paper and show your child where you can place it to dry.

18. Invite your child to choose a new piece of paper.

19. Invite your child to adhere the paper to the easel and assist if needed.

20. Invite your child to put their paper in a place to dry.

21. Invite your child to repeat as long as they are interested.

22. When they are finished, help them to remove their apron and put it away.

Written by Dorothy Harman

Parents, this is a book to put at the top of your “must read” list! It’s so user friendly and packed with such important information for all of us: parents, teachers, caregivers, and extended family. When I was halfway through it, I couldn't put it down. My grandson is in Montessori school, and I wanted to send a copy to his parents immediately!

Dorothy Harman has so much wisdom to share and inspiration to offer about parent-teacher relationships, keeping the child’s best interests as the common goal. She has created a book that has only 39 pages, and it is formatted in such a way that you can read whatever topic is of interest to you or is needed for your child. AND, there is a section within almost all the topics called “An Idea for Consideration,” where you can write notes. This section includes the idea, your reflections, your next steps, and discussion with the child's teacher. It is such a great tool for gathering your thoughts.

JUST A WORM

Written & illustrated by Marie Boyd

This book is illustrated using quill art techniques except for the worm (pen and ink) and the blue sky (digital). Its eye-catching colors and designs are quite beautiful. The author gives readers a lesson in quill art at the end of the book. The story itself is about the worm affirming that it is more than ‘just a worm.’ Along the way, the worm discovers how other garden insects contribute to the garden world. If you look closely, you’ll find the creature coming up on the next page. Although the story is wonderful for children from 3 to 7 years old, the quill art takes quite a bit of fine-motor control. It may be frustrating for children 3, 4, and possibly 5 years old, while 6 and above may really get into making quill art.

THE CIRCLES ALL AROUND US

Written by Brad Montague
Illustrated by Brad & Kristi Montague

This is a delightful story for children 3 to 7 years old, using ever enlarging circles to illustrate how we broaden our number and kinds of relationships among our human contacts and our world. It starts with a small child who draws a circle around himself that is only large enough for him. It shows the reader how small our scope is when we are infants. In fact, in infancy, humans really don’t know that there is anyone else except themselves. Gradually they begin to realize that there are others around them. And so, the circle becomes larger to include immediate family and primary caregivers. I’ll let you read this book to find out how far the author goes in expanding the circles. I will be a spoiler, though, and tell you the ending because it is so important. "…remember the first circle started with just the love you hold inside."

Recipes for Change

Written by Michael Platt
Illustrated by Alleanna Harris
Reviewed by Cheryl Allen

This book brings together so many interesting types of books. It is a cookbook, with stories from history and biographies. Each month of this book about Black history depicts an act of resistance and a recipe that is connected to the event. At the back of the book are short biographies of the leaders in the book.

Some of this information may be new to you, and some of it may present a slightly different angle of a piece of history. We may feel we know the leaders of the Montgomery Bus Boycott. In the December entry, you will learn about Georgia Gilmore and how she used her baking skills to help raise money for transportation for people who boycotted the bus system for more than a year. You can make her pound cake.

The recipes are easy to follow, and most need patience and possible adult guidance. While waiting for any of the recipes to be ready to eat, the stories can be read, and the detailed illustrations admired. In addition to the biographies in the back, there is a glossary and additional book suggestions.

This book is suggested for ages 8-12. It could be enjoyed by younger children, although they may need more assistance to make the recipes.

— A SERIOUS PARENT

Dear Parents,

You are right on target, and we applaud your conscientious approach to this complicated subject. The rule of thumb is to follow your child interests and seek to broaden their experiences until they are old enough to have found their passion. The purpose of extracurricular activities for young children is to try new things, develop new skills, and have opportunities to take direction from another adult besides parents and teachers at school.

We recommend that young children experience extracurriculars in small segments for the purpose of just trying them out. These are usually offered in areas such as sports, dance, drama, art, etc. Seek classes that are in short sections such as 8 weeks or a week-long summer program. The purpose of these of classes is to expose children to the activity or skill. These short introductions help parent and child determine interest, without overtaxing the child or family’s resources. These classes focus on the basics. It may be possible to engage your child in a summer camp that encompasses a number of different sports or types of dance at a single location. From there it is possible to decide where to focus your child and family’s resources in the years ahead.

Many towns have recreation sports leagues as well as travel leagues that require children to try out for a place on the team. However, your child may enjoy being a part of the experience at any level. Additionally, sometimes activities are offered as single day camps during days off from school. These may include computer skills, 3-D printing, cooking classes, etc. These one-day activities can help you widen a child’s awareness of the myriad of activities available to pursue.

As children mature, they begin to narrow their focus and gravitate toward some extracurricular activities more than others. Many begin to show an affinity for a particular activity such as scouting, a specific sport, a type of musical instrument, a dance class, etc. Now is the time to zone into one (or a few) of these areas and begin to focus your child’s after school time. You may eventually decide that private music or dance classes are for your child. Maybe your child is committed to soccer and is attending practice twice a week and playing a game once a week as well. Each of these comes with a time and financial commitment on your part, and that needs to be figured into the equation. Be sure to involve your child in the decision and not simply decide for them.

As you are making these decisions, remember to program in some free time for your child to have time outdoors to play, create, and spend unstructured time with friends. This is an important part of your child’s development as well. 

    content: `In the early 1980s Kitty Williams (now Bravo) and her former husband, Farmer Steve Williams, lived on 5 acres of land with their two young daughters in their small, old-Florida home on Ashton Road in Sarasota, FL. Farmer Steve dreamed of an organic farm, while Kitty dreamed of a Montessori school; both dreamed of making the world a better place. They established Countryside Montessori School, in January of 1984, on a side porch of their home, with just five children, and Steve farmed the land. During that winter and spring, the garage was remodeled, and they applied to the zoning department for permission to officially have a school on the property. In August of 1984, the garage classroom opened with about twenty children: ages 2 years 11 months to 6 years old. By the fall of 1985, the porch had been enclosed and a second Primary classroom was opened, bringing the total enrollment to about forty students.

By 1987, the school expanded to include an Elementary program with just a few first graders continuing from the Primary class. A Toddler classroom was established in a small building on the roadside that had been Farmer Steve’s produce store. Within a year, the Elementary class expanded to first through third grades with Primary moving to the small classroom that was once the produce store.

Countryside kept growing, and in 1989 they built a spacious classroom with natural light for the expanding Elementary class. Now the school had three Primary classes, one Lower Elementary class, and a group of very enthusiastic, committed parents.

During the 1990s, the dream kept growing and the Williams restructured the school as a non-profit with the hope that they could continue through the high school years. With the help of some parents, they acquired the portable buildings, which they remodeled to expand the Elementary program. By the fall of 1993, they had three Primary classrooms, two Lower Elementary classrooms, and one Upper Elementary classroom.

On the school’s 10th Anniversary, after a decade of growth and dreams, Kitty and Steve, along with a dedicated group of families and staff, began to partner with the Montessori Foundation and became the Foundation’s “lab school.” So many things were accomplished during the 90s. They changed the school's name to NewGate School (gate being an acronym for "global awareness through education"). After changing the name to NewGate School, they purchased one hundred acres of land for future development of a second campus, and added a Toddler class, another Upper Elementary class, and a 7th & 8th Year class (Middle School) at Ashton.

The dream wasn’t done yet! In the 2000s, NewGate opened its second campus on Clark Road and added the high school. In their 20th Anniversary year (2004) two beautiful things happened. First, a peace pole was erected in a lovely place in the center of the Ashton Road Campus in honor of Kitty’s work in Montessori for world peace. Second, NewGate had its first high school graduate! Big dreams were accomplished, and big challenges presented themselves. However, faith and determination did not wane and NewGate pushed forward with renewed assistance from the Montessori Foundation. When the Clark Road Campus closed, all students returned to the original campus on Ashton Road.

By the time the 30th Anniversary came around the school’s recovery was well underway, and in 2016, a new campus for the Secondary students was purchased in Lakewood Ranch. Now, in 2024, NewGate’s 40th Anniversary year, we have three campuses: the Ashton Road Campus; the Lakewood Ranch Campus; and the Global Campus (a virtual campus for Secondary students from around the US and the world). We serve children and adolescents from Toddlers through High School.

NewGate is proud to be the “lab school” of the Montessori Foundation (MF). Being the lab school of the Foundation means trying new ideas based on our tried-and-true Montessori principles. We have spent a lot of time developing models and systems for other schools to use as they grow and expand organizing new programs to enhance the already existing Montessori curriculum; creating a model for Montessori Secondary schools; sponsoring teacher training programs; and cultivating a community of respectful adults who mentor and guide children and adolescents by doing their best to live out the principles of peace.

    content: `One of my fondest memories I’ve shared with my granddaughter, Blakely, was talking about the time we went to the ballet together when she was five years old. We had watched the Nutcracker numerous times before we finally actually went to see a live performance. I bought her a special dress to wear, we got all fancied up and ready, and off we went.

Everyone sitting around us looked at her in wonderment as she wore a very excited expression on her face. The music began and the ballet started to unfold. 

She leaned in next to me and said, “Grammie, that’s not how Clara should be doing that dance.” It seems that she had memorized the version we had watched, and I had neglected to let her know that every dance troop’s choreographer interprets the dance parts a little bit differently. She still enjoyed the show and every time I stole a glance over at her I could see total rapture on her face.

Her interests have long ago steered away from watching the Nutcracker. She is now almost fourteen and an avid soccer player. However, I just recently asked if she remembered that night. “Grammie,” she said, “how could I ever forget it.” I hope she shares a similar experience with her grandchildren if the time comes.

Creating lasting memories and sharing your passions with your grandchildren creates bonds that can’t be undone, so invest the time in them and with them. The payoff is huge and lasting.

    content: `Purpose

• Develop independence in care of self

• Strengthening and refinement of movements of the hands

Age

• 16 months and up

Young children enjoy learning to care for themselves and their environment. Dr. Montessori described these activities as Practical Life activities and you will find them in all Montessori classrooms from birth through high school.

When children learn to take care of themselves and their environment, they experience inner pride and confidence. This supports their need to do for themself independently and serves their intellectual, physical, and language development.

Learning to clean shoes is a fun activity for young children. As a parent, you can introduce this activity and keep it available to your child in a space that makes sense: near your entry; on a cleaning supply shelf; or even in your broom closet. Once you show your child how to use this activity, keep the set intact (don’t let the pieces migrate around the house), remind your child of the true purpose if they use the tools for other activities, and remove the activity if your child is not able to use it safely.

INSTRUCTION

• Trace the shoe silhouette template on the adhesive vinyl with the marker.

• Cut out the Shoe silhouette and set aside.

• Wipe the tray surface with a clean dry towel.

• Remove the backing of the cut shoe shape.

• Place the shoe shape in the center of the tray so that the length of the shoe shape is parallel with the handle sides of the tray.

• Press the shoe shape with your hands and smooth out any bubbles.

• Place the brush dish on the upper left side of the tray.

• Place the brush in the brush dish.

Lesson

• As with all Practical Life activities, show your child the tools you will need, what they are called, and how to hold them.

• Remind your child that you will show them how to do the activity and then they will have a turn.

• To clean shoes, place one shoe on the shoe shape and one shoe to the left of you on the floor.

• Place one hand in the shoe, and hold the brush with the other.

• Gently brush the shoe.

• Turn the shoe side to side so your child can see that you are looking for dirt.

• Place the brush back in the dish.

• Place the shoe next to the one on the floor.

• Pick up the other shoe and place it on the tray.

• Invite your child to have a turn!

When your child is done, they can see what other shoes are around the house to clean. This activity combined with the hunt of finding shoes can make this activity last a long time. Once your child understands the activity, you can say things like..."I think I remember a pair of brown shoes in your dad's closet..." By doing this you are supporting your child's awareness of their environment, need to engage socially and genuinely, as well as your child's language development. Try using different adjectives to describe shoes they may find. Scan`,

    content: `by Becky Noble

I have been a strong supporter of Montessori education since before Ben was born, having read several of Maria Montessori's books and applied those methods when working with my employer's young children.

When it was time for Ben's dad and me to decide on a kindergarten for Ben, we considered a few options. Ben’s dad had been in public school throughout his education and felt that, if it was good enough for him, it was good enough for Ben. He was, however, willing to look at private schools as well. I recall visiting at least three schools, including the public elementary school closest to our home, a Christian School, and Countryside/NewGate Montessori.

Even though I expected lower standards at the public school, I was floored when the teacher told us that not every student was expected to know the whole alphabet by the end of the kindergarten year. Ben and his preschool classmates all knew the alphabet and had started reading by that time. Although the education level at the Christian School seemed to be up to my expectations, the classrooms were noisy and cluttered.

When we visited Countryside/NewGate, I knew that was where Ben would flourish. The quiet, orderly classrooms provided an ideal place for a young child to learn. I appreciated the respect with which each student was treated, and the way conflicts were resolved. I found the three-year age span in the classrooms to be an excellent way for a student to experience being a beginner, learning from the older students, and to work his/her way up to being a leader among the students, helping the younger ones. I was also happy to hear that each student could progress at his/ her own pace, not being held back to the level of the lowest common denominator.

Yes, there were some sacrifices made to have Ben attend Montessori school all the way through high school. Ben’s dad and I separated two months after Ben began Montessori school. I faced all the challenges that single parents face: reworking my schedule to accommodate Ben's needs; trying to make ends meet; figuring out the financial aspect; etc. It was a very difficult time, but I was determined to provide Ben with what I considered to be his best educational opportunity. Looking back on it now, that was one of the most valuable things that I have gone through. I learned to be resourceful and to stand by my principles when it came to raising Ben.

Ben’s dad and I contributed to a portion of the tuition, but the bulk of it was on my shoulders. Even though it was a stretch to pay each month, I was not willing to lower my standards and deny Ben the opportunities he had at Countryside/New Gate School. The school helped with a generous contribution in the form of a scholarship. I believe paying at least a portion of the tuition gave me a bigger stake in my child's education and I tended to be even more involved in it. When my new partner, Michael, came into our family full-time, he was active in projects and events at the school as he saw and supported the value of the education that Ben was getting. Ben graduated from NewGate School in 2005.

Now that Ben is grown, married, and the father of two beautiful girls, Michael and I support Ben and Kara's choice to enroll Aurora and Felicity in a good Montessori school. I'm delighted that both girls are doing so well in that environment.

Becky Noble grew up in rural Pennsylvania, traveling around the country with her family every summer. For four years after graduation, she sailed the European coast and Caribbean, overseeing the galleys and teaching math and world history aboard the schooners of the Flint School. She transferred to their Sarasota, Florida office to help build ActionQuest travel adventure and Lifeworks community service programs that would eventually become Global Expeditions. She recently relocated to Franklin, Tennessee to be close to Ben and his family. When not spending time with her granddaughters, Becky now runs an online business and is a watercolor artist who enjoys sharing her knowledge with young people.`,

    content: `The Montessori Method, developed by Dr. Maria Montessori, is renowned for its child-centered approach to education. Within the Montessori classroom, language development plays a crucial role in nurturing a child's ability to communicate effectively. While the Montessori Method itself is adaptable to various writing systems and cultural contexts, it often incorporates a left-to-right progression in language activities and materials. This article explores the reasons behind the left-to-right progression in Montessori language development, provides examples of materials used in the classroom, and highlights research insights on this topic.

The Importance of Left-to-Right Progression: The left-to-right progression is a convention followed in many languages for reading and writing. Introducing children to language and literacy skills in a manner that aligns with this convention can facilitate their understanding of written texts and prepare them for independent reading and writing. By incorporating left-to-right progression in language activities, Montessori educators create an environment that not only supports language development but also prepares children for successful literacy experiences beyond the classroom. The consistent use of this convention helps children build essential cognitive and linguistic skills, fostering their ability to read, write, and engage with written language effectively.

Examples of Materials and Activities in Montessori Language Development

Sandpaper Letters: Sandpaper Letters are tactile materials with textured letters mounted on wooden boards. Children trace the shape of each letter with their fingers while simultaneously associating the sound with the symbol. These letters are typically arranged from left to right, reinforcing the directionality of writing.

Moveable Alphabet: The Moveable Alphabet is a set of individual letters, often made of wood or plastic, that children can manipulate to form words. Children choose letters and arrange them from left to right to represent the sounds they hear in words. This activity aligns with the left-to-right progression of writing in many languages.

Reading Books: Montessori classrooms include a variety of books at different reading levels. As children progress in their reading abilities, they are encouraged to read from left to right, following the conventional reading direction. Teachers provide guidance and support as children navigate the pages and sentences.

Research Insights: While specific research articles linking Montessori materials with left-to-right progression in language development are limited, studies have highlighted the effectiveness of the Montessori method in enhancing early literacy skills. Research by Lillard and Else-Quest (2006) found that children in Montessori programs showed higher levels of phonological awareness, letter recognition, and early reading skills compared to non-Montessori peers. Furthermore, studies by Rathunde and Csikszentmihalyi (2005) and Dohrmann et al. (2007) indicated that Montessori education fosters independent reading and writing skills, with children developing a sense of confidence and engagement in their language abilities. Introducing children to language and literacy skills in a manner that reflects this convention has several important benefits: alignment with reading and writing conventions; cognitive organization; structure preparation for independent reading; and writing consistency and familiarity.

Conclusion: While the Montessori Method itself is adaptable to different writing systems and languages, it often incorporates a left-to-right progression in language development activities and materials. The use of materials, such as Sandpaper Letters, Moveable Alphabets, and reading books, supports the natural progression of reading and writing skills in many cultures. While further research specifically linking Montessori materials to left-to-right progression is limited (as mentioned earlier in this article), existing studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the Montessori Method in promoting early literacy skills and independent language exploration in children.

Overall, the left-to-right progression in Montessori language development aligns with the conventions followed in many languages, providing children with a solid foundation for future reading and writing skills. By understanding and practicing this natural flow of language, children are equipped with the tools to navigate and comprehend the written world around them.

    content: `Note from the Director: This article includes so many tips for helping children and adolescents in the transition from one school to another. It is packed with practical ways to be of support to them whether they are changing schools or levels within schools. Much of the material applies to all ages, but you will need to determine what is age appropriate for your child or adolescent’s stage of development.

Change is a part of life. It is not always easy, but it speaks to the beautiful ebb and flow of our existence. When we trust the transitions, the changing seasons, and all the new roads we choose to take, we can fully celebrate our journey. The ability to gracefully embrace and receive change is a key to living a fulfilled, meaningful life and is a powerful part of our growth. If we can help our children embrace change, they will have the foundation to meet life with the resilience, optimism, fortitude, and joy that it demands.

Just as this age group is learning to cope with the emotional and physical turbulence of early adolescence, along comes the new challenge of transitioning from elementary to middle school; it also comes with new expectations, from academic to social. Changing schools from a Montessori school to a more traditional school or changing levels within a Montessori school is the perfect opportunity to teach about graceful transitions and embracing change.

All children manage change differently, but most Montessori students adapt to their new school environment fairly quickly, making new friends and experiencing success, within the definition of success understood in their new school. This phenomenon is possible because they have the advantage of growing up in Montessori. Montessori programs focus on helping children develop self-motivation, confidence, independence, problem-solving, and coping strategies for new situations, along with a strong sense of respect and responsibility. These skills, along with supportive parents and caregivers to help them embrace the change, will serve them well in any transition they make. What follows are suggestions to help make the school transition smoother for all.

Follow Montessori Principles In The Home
Following Montessori principles at home can be an impactful way of nurturing and maintaining skills and lessons that your tween learned from their experience in the Montessori school. Encouraging independence, love of learning, curiosity, self-motivation, and order are fundamental to the Montessori approach and, if nurtured, will continue to serve your tween as they make this transition.

Model A Positive Attitude About Change

Children are regularly learning how to be adaptable and flexible from their parents/caregivers. When children see you try new things, take risks, and handle change with grace, they are more likely to follow suit.

Talk to your child about change in a positive way. For example, you might say, “I am a bit nervous about starting a new job today, and it’s ok to be nervous. I am going to make myself feel better by listening to some good music. Even though I am nervous, I am also excited about meeting new people and making new friends.”

When your tweens are anxious, help them change the story they are telling themselves about what might happen. Encourage them to imagine all the great things that could happen instead of all the things that could go wrong. By changing the story and the images, anxiety can turn to excitement.

Acknowledge The Uncertainty And Loss

Acknowledging the fear and anxiety regarding the change that both you as a parent/caregiver and your tween is experiencing makes it much easier to talk about and embrace the change together. This is a good opportunity to explain the differences between Montessori and traditional schools, emphasizing the positives of both school systems.

While we want to be positive about the change, change also means that there will be a loss of friends, teachers, familiar routines, etc. Let your tween experience the sadness, and let them know they can speak to you about it or talk it over with friends that are experiencing the same thing.

Offer your tween a sense of agency by involving them in making choices... it can be as simple as letting them select a new backpack.

Practice Mindfulness

Practice mindfulness with your tween; it will help both of you to accept the present moment as it is, without judgment. This mindset can be useful when facing unexpected changes. After acknowledging your anxiety or fear and telling yourself that it’s ok to feel this way at this moment, carry on in a way that purposefully isn’t stuck in the negative mindset.

Show Empathy

Acknowledging your tween’s emotions will help them feel seen and heard. For example, a parent/caregiver could say, “I understand that moving schools is a big fear of yours. There will be new things that you are not used to; I can see how not knowing what to expect can cause anxiety.”

Rephrasing the tween’s emotions can help to increase their self-awareness and emotional intelligence, which will help them identify what they are feeling and can thereby talk about it.

Engage In Open Communication

Talking and listening are key to helping your tween manage change. It is a valuable opportunity for you to sit and talk with your tween about what they think about this upcoming change, what is making them hesitant or nervous about this new opportunity, and what you can do together to make the process easier.

Find The Root Of Anxiety And Fear

Ask questions to help guide your tween to what may be truly bothering them. For example, “What are you feeling right now?” or “What feels scary to you about this?” or “What is the thing you think about most regarding this change?”

Encourage An Open Mind Towards Change

Once you get a handle on what is causing them the most stress or fear, you can try to address it with your child ahead of time to help the change go smoothly. Start by asking them to reflect on what has helped them through other transitions they have had to make in their life and what they would add to that process to support this change. Change can feel overwhelming and scary to tweens because it often signals a loss of control. Offer your tween a sense of agency by involving them in making choices regarding this change, it can be as simple as letting them select a new backpack.

Maintain Routines Yet Add New Ones

If possible, maintain your family’s normal routines. It will provide a sense of normalcy and security for your tween, since they will be experiencing new routines at school. You may also want to consider creating new routines for them to associate with this new phase of their life.

For example, you may decide to have family game nights on Thursdays. Get your tween involved in deciding on a new addition to the family schedule. Connecting as a family provides comfort for tweens who are navigating change, and these new activities can help.

Be Patient
“It will take the time it takes” for your tween to adjust to a new school. Don’t assume either that they will have a hard time adjusting or that they will have an easy time adjusting.

Be patient and let your child know you are there for them. Reassure them that they are going to have a great school year, and, before they know it, they’ll no longer feel like the new kid.

PREPARE FOR LOGISTICAL, SOCIAL, AND ACADEMIC CHANGE

Researchers have found that tweens anticipating the move to middle school worry about these aspects of the change: the logistical, the social, and the academic.

 LOGISTICAL

• Accompany your tween on a campus or new-environment tour and orientation. The better you understand the logistics of the school and the program, the more you can support your tween. Invite their friends who are also making the transition.

• Ask for a copy of your tween’s schedule and mark the locations and times of their classes on the school map. Ask for the length of the break between classes. Walk the route between classes with them. Time it out with your tween, so they can see how long it takes to walk from class to class.

• If you have an opportunity, sign your tween up for any summer programs that may be offered by the school for incoming students. Not only will your tween get to know the campus, but they also will have the opportunity to make some friends in a much more relaxed atmosphere.

• Review the rules and requirements in the student handbook. Ask the school staff for any clarification or questions you may have before the beginning of school.

• If the school has lockers, make sure they know how to open the lock. Or, buy your tween a lock with time to practice opening and closing it.

SOCIAL

• Talk to your tweens often and openly about friendship. Equip them with the information and knowledge to make good friendship choices. Talk about how they should treat other people and how they should allow other people to treat them. Encourage them to stay away from gossip and drama. Help them learn how to navigate conflict and how to resolve disagreement. Remind them to be kind and inclusive.

• Emphasize the importance of being who they are. Remind them that it is more important to be yourself than to fit in. Encourage them to spend time with people they like and with whom they are comfortable, but to also look for less obvious connections and be open. Talk about the importance of not compromising their values to gain friends.

• Support your tween’s personal interests. Suggest your tween join sports teams, school clubs, or extracurricular activities.

• Offer them opportunities to spend time with any new friends they have made.

• If they are experiencing loneliness, you could arrange a get together with old friends.

• Encourage your tweens to join conversations or activities. You can role play how to join without interrupting or how to add something interesting or relevant to the conversation in progress.

• Let them see your own positive supportive joyful friendships.

• Get to know the tweens that your tween spends time with, and, if possible, their parents or caregivers.

• Discuss how their bodies are (or will be) changing and the importance of self-care and good hygiene.

ACADEMIC

• Meet with your tween to discuss academic expectations in the new school and at a new level and how the family is going to support them.

• If you have concerns about your child’s academic needs, meet with the middle school’s academic team in the spring (before they begin school) to discuss your concerns.

• Reach out to the teachers to introduce yourself and offer any support. You can give teachers some information about your child regarding their strengths and where they experience challenges. This introduction is a good time to give teachers strategies that have been successful specifically for your child.

• Find out if there is a homework hotline or if there is a tutor service.

• Help your tween with their time management and organizational skills. Work together on a schedule that allows for study time, social time, chore time, etc. Show your tween how to organize binders, set up assignment calendars, and use an academic planner.

• Receiving grades may be new for a Montessori student. Try not to react either way to the grades. Making sure your tween is happy and navigating the expectations of the new system is the most important factor in the first couple of months.

• Stay connected to your tween’s schoolwork by lending support when needed. Know due dates for homework, projects, or other tasks. Periodically check to see if your tween is getting assignments done, yet continue to build independence.

• This should not be a problem for a former Montessori student, but encourage your tween to be their own advocate by discussing problems and solutions with their teachers on their own. Of course, you will be ready to support them if need be.

• If your tween is struggling, meet with the academic team sooner than later.

• Model the behavior you want to encourage in your tween. Are you arriving at places on time? Are you keeping appointments? Do you use a calendar to keep your schedule?

As your child crosses this bridge on the path towards a new school experience, they don’t disappear, they transform, and you get to witness this marvelous show of becoming. Change will be their constant ally, leading them through unexplored places and presenting opportunities for growth and self-discovery. Their willingness to adapt and evolve will be essential in shaping who they become. If they learn to embrace the change, the challenges, the unpredictability, and the disconcertment, they will truly uncover the unlimited potential that lies within them.

Teach them how to embrace change, and watch them emerge… stronger, peaceful, and wiser.

    content: `Life has changed for many families over the years, and today it is more important than ever for schools and families to work together to create a nurturing community that supports parents, teachers, and children. Schools can be much more than where children learn basic skills; they can become communities where people feel safe, connected, and welcomed.

In most Montessori schools, this is already the case. Their byline could be similar to this line from Yeats: “There are no strangers here. Only friends you have yet to meet.”

Montessori parents often describe their children's schools as the center of their friendship circles.

Here are some of the many ways that great Montessori schools create community and partnership with their families, faculty, and staff.

Perhaps your child’s school already does many of them. If not, perhaps now is the time to gently and positively see if you can interest the school’s leadership, teachers, and other families into taking a first step.

• People smile at everyone they meet and take pains to make them feel welcome. They carefully introduce new families and staff members into the school community.

• Teachers and staff greet people as they arrive to drop off and pick up their children.

• The school encourages the entire community to get to know one another.

• School leaders and teachers make it easy for parents and students to meet with them.

• Coffee and Conversation: At many schools, families are invited to gather once a month, often right after drop off, in a central area to drink coffee while engaging in lively discussions. This not only strengthens bonds among parents but also offers a relaxed setting for informal interactions with school leaders.

• Parents are encouraged to observe classrooms in action. This can be particularly enlightening for those new to Montessori, offering a window into their children's daily learning environment. Of course, this requires careful scheduling between parents and classroom teachers.

• They respond to any family crisis with warmth and caring. They call, visit, send cards, and lend a helping hand.

• They encourage parents to volunteer in the classrooms and on committees. They do everything possible to ensure that they have a positive experience.

• They keep volunteer assignments short to allow them to get a sense of completion.

• They avoid long boring meetings, politics, or wrangling.

• The school helps parents feel confident that their children are getting a first-class education.

• The school always has name tags at parent gatherings.

• They hold at least two “Student Demonstration” events a year: a daytime or evening where children get to bring one or two people to school as their guests. The children teach their parents or friends how to do what they do in class.

• Some schools organize a once-a-month social for all their Infant-Toddler families on Saturday afternoons. They provide an appropriate activity, such as art, music, or a sensory experience that can easily be recreated at home. Some schools hold a variation on this with “Parent-and-Me” session held at school.

• They create a tuition-funded financial-aid program with a goal that no child will have to leave school because of financial problems. They ensure that their financial-aid process is warm, friendly, and strictly confidential.

• Many Montessori schools coordinate a Parent Ambassadors program. Parent Ambassadors are a group of dedicated parents who play a crucial role in facilitating communication between the school and families. They use email and telephone/messaging chains, enabling them to efficiently remind families of upcoming events, answer queries, and recruit volunteers for various school activities. They also welcome new families into the school community.

• 
Many Montessori schools hold monthly Community Meetings where parents, teachers, administrators, and interested students are invited to meet to explore issues of common interest in an open forum. Community Meetings often offer feedback and advice to the school’s leadership and Board. Parents and teachers who participate tend to gain a much deeper understanding of the school's mission, strengths, and the issues that challenge it. Many appreciate the opportunity to have a voice in the life of the school.

• 
At a Community Meeting or other event, someone will propose a toast to the school. People share memories and stories.

• 
Many schools open and close the school year with special ceremonies.

• 
They hold special social events for the community. A few examples might include a picnic, an old-fashioned square dance, a fall festival, a winter fest, a spring picnic, a theater party, a potluck dinner, or a family camp-out on the school grounds.

• 
Childcare at evening parent meetings.

• 
Montessori schools work hard to nurture every child's artistic and musical potential. Every student aged five and above receives instrumental instruction, participates in ensemble performances, and studies art. These programs have led to remarkable displays of talent. The school stages musical theater and ensemble performances during the year.

• 
Ideally, schools have a room on campus where parents can sit and read about Montessori or talk with other parents.

• 
They keep a pot of coffee and/or tea going for parents who drop in.

• 
The school phone is answered promptly with warmth.

• 
There is a suggestion box for parents, teachers, and students.

• 
They frequently ask families, teachers, and staff what they think.

• 
They hold informal discussions to brainstorm and explore new ideas.

• 
They defend your community against hostile or negative parents, children, and staff.

• 
They take the time to explain things fully.

• 
They publish an Annual Report on the state of the school.

• 
They hold school-wide talent shows or art exhibits where students of all ages can showcase their talents or artwork.

A Montessori byline could be similar to this line from Yeats:

There are no stranger here. Only friends you have yet to meet.

• 
Older students mentor younger ones in various areas, such as academics, arts, or sports.

• 
They make sure that no one ever feels threatened or blind-sided at a parent/teacher conference.

• 
Many schools have student-led conferences during which students guide their parents through their learning journey. This can be especially empowering for older students, giving them a chance to showcase their progress and achievements.

• 
They gather the children's work, stories, and art into portfolios to give to their families.

• 
They hold Parent Forums: open discussions in which parents explore an issue of broad interest among themselves.

• 
They create an atmosphere of safety, cleanliness, and timeless beauty on their campus.

• 
They celebrate cultural diversity within the school with festivals encouraging families to share their heritage and learn about others while fostering a rich, inclusive community.

• 
They organize sports events or fun runs where families participate in activities or challenges.

• 
To add a fun twist to community engagements, some Montessori schools have introduced innovative events such as the "Are-You-Smarter-Than-a-Montessori-Kid?" contest. This light-hearted game challenges parents to answer questions that children learn in their Montessori classes, such as recognizing European flags or solving complex puzzles. These events not only provide entertainment but also offer parents a glimpse into the depth and breadth of their children's knowledge.

• 
They make a commitment as a school community to an ongoing program of self-study and school improvement in which parents, teachers, older students, and staff can get involved.

• 
They take the time as a community to develop and periodically review a "Blueprint of the School’s Educational Philosophy and Core Values.”

• 
Teachers call parents regularly just to share good news or to touch base.

• 
They make sure that new volunteers are carefully taught how to do the tasks that they've undertaken.

• 
They publish an attractive school newsletter on a regular basis that contains articles that parents want to read and pictures of children doing interesting things.

• 
They give each other lots of acknowledgement and a sense of pride.

• 
They send out press releases of any and all newsworthy information to the media.

• 
They create a special acknowledgment pin to recognize parents and teachers who have made an extraordinary contribution of service to the school.

• 
They design a colorful window decal with the name and logo of the school and give them to parents and teachers to put in the car's rear windows.

• 
They create a terrific school t-shirt and include at least one in the price of tuition and "give" it to every child.

• 
They develop a Montessori Speaker Series, inviting experts in Montessori education, child psychology, and related fields to speak to parents and local families.

• 
They host a panel of older students, alumni, and parents who share the positive impact Montessori education has had on their lives. This can be particularly inspiring for new families.

• 
They facilitate support groups for parents to discuss common challenges and share advice, particularly helpful for those adjusting to the Montessori system.

• 
They involve parents and families in community service projects organized by the school, reflecting the Montessori values of social responsibility and community engagement.

• 
They post a page on the school website to acknowledge the teachers, families, or special volunteers for their service to the school.

• 
They organize book clubs for parents, focusing on literature related to Montessori education and child development. Discussions can be facilitated by teachers or knowledgeable parents, fostering a deeper understanding of the Montessori philosophy.

• 
They encourage student-run cafés. Some provide a practical learning experience for students and a gathering spot for the community where parents, teachers, and students can interact informally, enhancing community ties.

• 
The share meals at various events, underscoring the importance of coming together and bonding over food. This tradition is essential for building strong, lasting relationships within the school community.

Montessori schools tend to be vibrant communities. Their unique traditions, commitment to arts and culture, and dedication to creating a warm and inclusive environment exemplify the best of Montessori education.

    content: `Dear Parents and Caregivers,

Yes! It’s spring and our days are getting longer, new life is everywhere, and we can open our homes and lives to a breath of fresh air. This is our last issue of Tomorrow’s Child for the 2023-2024 school year. All the surveys, focus groups, and analysis have paid off thanks to you and your school leaders. Look how far we’ve come!

• The Montessori App makes accessing trusted resources and information easier for you.

• Wit & Wisdom, our monthly evening discussions with special guests, have allowed us to get to know some of you on a deeper and more personal level than ever before.

• Our new platform for the Montessori Family Life Webinars has given us opportunities to interact and connect more easily.

• The new design for Tomorrow’s Child is filled with articles and lots of photos for every level. Each issue is meant to have something for everyone.

• Regular postings on Facebook and Instagram give you information on upcoming events and inspiring parenting tips.

• The Montessori Foundation has made The Parenting Puzzle: ‘Peacing’ It All Together available and free to schools that are members of the Montessori Family Alliance. Schools are encouraged to offer this Montessori parenting course to their families. The Parenting Puzzle was specifically designed to help families use Montessori principles and strategies at home to cultivate cooperation, collaboration, and calm.

• The Montessori Family Life Team has invited exciting new guests and trusted regulars who are experts in parenting practices, child and adolescent development, Montessori philosophy and pedagogy, to have conversations with you every week.

And there’s more to come. We plan to continue sending school leaders a monthly newsletter to pass along to you. The newsletter highlights each Tomorrow’s Child issue and current webinars. It also lets you see past articles, book reviews and webinars - all intended to enhance your Montessori Family Life experience and resources.

As we look forward to the 2024-2025 school year, I am reminded of a song that an old friend, Sanford Jones, wrote called “At the Beginning Is a Good Place to Be.” Let us move forward with faith, trust, and hope in our children and families.

    content: `These three words can guide your choices as a parent of a young child.
You make choices based on what you believe to be best for your child and family. These choices may be based on emotion, assumptions, or exasperation. I encourage you to consider making your decisions based on a system you know can work.

When you can create a system for yourself in your decision making for your children, you may find that you have better, less-stressful outcomes and more confidence as a parent.

Although all situations and families are different, many of the choices you make as a parent in a day can go back to these three words: Choose. Move. Repeat.

These are the three freedoms that Dr. Maria Montessori provided for in her first classroom and are still part of every authentic Montessori environment (whether home or school).

The freedom to choose.

The freedom to move.

And the freedom to repeat .

Within a classroom, this may seem easy, but what does this mean as a parent?

I recommend that as a parent, when faced with making a decision about What’s for dinner? Do we go to the park or on a walk? or Will you wear a blue or green hat? you come back to these three freedoms.

Ask yourself: How can I offer my child choice in this situation?

For example, if it is dinner, can he choose between carrots or green beans?

Then ask, How can my child have the freedom to move in this situation?

You can offer your child freedom of movement with dinner is by inviting them to help set the table or wash the carrots?

Whenever you incorporate movement into a task, you help children connect and learn. Children need to move to learn and can get very frustrated when expected to be still.

The next question you can ask is: What part of this can we repeat?

Well, when it comes to dinner, I suggest just one dinner (Ha!). You can think about what are the repetitions within the dinner? When setting the table, how many place settings are needed? When washing the carrots, how many carrots need to be washed? Then how can this become a daily activity? Can you repeat this multiple times a week? Can your child come to count on this as a predictable routine?

Choose, move, repeat. These three words can be a system and checklist for parents while bringing consistency, predictability, and routine to your days. They are the three words that can create harmony in your busy family life.

Parents, this is a book to put at the top of your “must read” list! It’s so user friendly and packed with such important information for all of us: parents, teachers, caregivers, and extended family. When I was halfway through it, I couldn’t put it down. My grandson is in Montessori school, and I wanted to send a copy to his parents immediately!

Dorothy Harman has so much wisdom to share and inspiration to offer about parent-teacher relationships, keeping the child’s best interests as the common goal. She has created a book that has only 39 pages, and it is formatted in such a way that you can read whatever topic is of interest to you or is needed for your child. AND, there is a section within almost all the topics called “An Idea for Consideration,” where you can write notes. This section includes the idea, your reflections, your next steps, and discussion with the child’s teacher. It is such a great tool for gathering your thoughts.

This book is illustrated using quill art techniques except for the worm (pen and ink) and the blue sky (digital). Its eye-catching colors and designs are quite beautiful. The author gives readers a lesson in quill art at the end of the book. The story itself is about the worm affirming that it is more than ‘just a worm.’ Along the way, the worm discovers how other garden insects contribute to the garden world. If you look closely, you’ll find the creature coming up on the next page. Although the story is wonderful for children from 3 to 7 years old, the quill art takes quite a bit of fine-motor control. It may be frustrating for children 3, 4, and possibly 5 years old, while 6 and above may really get into making quill art.`,

Written by Christy Hale

I love this book for the classroom or at home! Christy Hale based this book on our land and water forms from the cultural area of Montessori classrooms. She not only wrote the text (of which there are just the names of each land or water form on that page) but also, she is an artist and did a wonderful job with the colors and illustrations. The way she designed the book is so clear and crisp. Children will not be distracted by too many words as they discover this part of our natural world. It’s so much fun, like magic, when the reader carefully turns the page and sees how each water form has an opposite landform.

To top it all off, Ms. Hale has included a fold-out chart at the back of the book with more information about the land and water forms and a map to see where the large ones are located around the world. Children ages 4-8 years will love this book!`,

Have you ever wondered if there are stages to parenthood like there are for childhood? The answer is, “Yes. There are.” Ellen Galinsky did an in-depth study of parents during different times from when their children were “imagined” to when their children were grown and leaving home.

My children are in their 30s and I now have a grandson who is seven years old. It was interesting to me to think about him when my daughter-in-law was pregnant, then in the first months after he was born, and on into the elementary years. As a grandparent I can see him differently than when my own children were growing and changing but there are many similarities to the parent stages. You are probably in the midst of a parenting stage or stages, depending on whether you have one or more children. This book may help you sort out and better understand your own feelings and thoughts as well as your parenting partner’s.`,

Carolinda Goodman’s book is written as a poem. She describes in a rhythmic way all the full moons around the year. She gives the name of the moon and why it got that name. Mariia Luzina beautifully illustrates each moon and the earthly surroundings according to the name and season. The illustrations really enhance the poetry from the author.

On every page of this book the text is in English and Spanish. What a joy! This book was written in a way that 4-year-olds to 8-year-olds will get something age-appropriate from it. For the 4-year-olds, they’ll learn something they may not have known about each other and for the 8-year-olds it may spark some interest in further research about biology or maybe genealogy. Oh… and the photographs are magnificent! The author has also included activities for children at the back of the book. Again, I think this book would be good for home or school.`,

This would be a great book for four- to 7-year-olds, especially when studying Asia. The story begins in an Early Childhood or Lower Elementary classroom when their teacher reads them a story about dragons and then asks them to make dragons of their own. Amy became frustrated because the dragons were not turning out as she wished they would. After school she and her friends went to her house and her grandmother read them a story about dragons. Gramma’s story triggered a memory of something up in the attic. Teachers will love this story for cultural studies, art projects, and developing reading skills. Parents will like it, too.`,

    content: `Water Land: Land and Water Forms Around the World

Written by Christy Hale

I love this book for the classroom or at home! Christy Hale based this book on our land and water forms from the cultural area of Montessori classrooms. She not only wrote the text (of which there are just the names of each land or water form on that page) but also, she is an artist and did a wonderful job with the colors and illustrations. The way she designed the book is so clear and crisp. Children will not be distracted by too many words as they discover this part of our natural world. It's so much fun, like magic, when the reader carefully turns the page and sees how each water form has an opposite landform.

To top it all off, Ms. Hale has included a fold-out chart at the back of the book with more information about the land and water forms and a map to see where the large ones are located around the world. Children ages 4-8 years will love this book!

The Six Stages of Parenthood

Written by Ellen Galinsky

Have you ever wondered if there are stages to parenthood like there are for childhood? The answer is, “Yes. There are.” Ellen Galinsky did an in-depth study of parents during different times from when their children were “imagined” to when their children were grown and leaving home.

My children are in their 30s and I now have a grandson who is seven years old. It was interesting to me to think about him when my daughter-in-law was pregnant, then in the first months after he was born, and on into the elementary years. As a grandparent I can see him differently than when my own children were growing and changing but there are many similarities to the parent stages. You are probably in the midst of a parenting stage or stages, depending on whether you have one or more children. This book may help you sort out and better understand your own feelings and thoughts as well as your parenting partner’s.

Once in a Full Moon

Written by Carolinda Goodman

Illustrated by Mariia Luzina

Carolinda Goodman’s book is written as a poem. She describes in a rhythmic way all the full moons around the year. She gives the name of the moon and why it got that name. Mariia Luzina beautifully illustrates each moon and the earthly surroundings according to the name and season. The illustrations really enhance the poetry from the author. Wonderful for at home or school for children ages 4-8 years.

All the Colors We Are: The Story of How We Get Our Skin Color

Todos los colores de nuestra piel: La historia de por qué tenemos diferentes colores de piel

Written by Katie Kissinger

Photographed by Chris Bohnhoff

On every page of this book the text is in English and Spanish. What a joy! This book was written in a way that 4-year-olds to 8-year-olds will get something age-appropriate from it. For the 4-year-olds, they’ll learn something they may not have known about each other and for the 8-year-olds it may spark some interest in further research about biology or maybe genealogy. Oh… and the photographs are magnificent! The author has also included activities for children at the back of the book. Again, I think this book would be good for home or school.

Amy Wu and the Patchwork Dragon

Written by Kat Zhang

Illustrated by Charlene Chua

This would be a great book for four- to 7-year-olds, especially when studying Asia. The story begins in an Early Childhood or Lower Elementary classroom when their teacher reads them a story about dragons and then asks them to make dragons of their own. Amy became frustrated because the dragons were not turning out as she wished they would. After school she and her friends went to her house and her grandmother read them a story about dragons. Gramma’s story triggered a memory of something up in the attic. Teachers will love this story for cultural studies, art projects, and developing reading skills. Parents will like it, too.

WE ARE SENDING OUR CHILD TO A MONTESSORI SCHOOL TO LEARN HOW TO CONCENTRATE, AMONG OTHER THINGS. WE ALSO WANT TO ENCOURAGE HER TO CONCENTRATE AND FOCUS AT HOME. WE SEE IT IN SCHOOL MUCH MORE THAN WE DO AT HOME. ANY ADVICE TO HELP US WORK ON THIS IMPORTANT SKILL? — SOMEWHAT FRAZZLED PARENTS

It is not unusual for the school day to get the best part of your child’s concentration. That is when they are at their freshest, most rested, and are often putting their best selves forward. When they return home after a full (or even a partial) day at school, they have mostly used up their focus energy and have little left to give. Educators and psychologists say that this is often when children show their worst behavior, as it is safe to let their guard down in the place of unconditional love.

You can indeed foster concentration at home through both your home environment and when you interact with your child through your shared experiences. Within your home, be sure there is a quiet place for your child to play that minimizes noise or distractions. This can be as simple as a mat or a small table and chairs away from the hustle and bustle of the rest of the family. Obviously, if your child is very young, you need to be sure you can see them to ensure their safety. Be certain that a group of activities are available to your child so that they can make individual choices without you.

Concentration develops when a child gets “lost in play” or is deeply engrossed in an activity of their own choosing. While it is positive to introduce your child to something new and offer new experiences, avoid doing so, as this can break their concentration on an activity previously chosen. It is constructive to offer suggestions as to the activities you place in their space and what you offer to them. Rotate those activities regularly as their interests and developmental level constantly are in flux. Be sure favorite activities are always available and maybe something new and interesting for a holiday or birthday. Talk to your child about what activity is calling to them now. New books, activity kits, and building materials can be part of the ongoing family discussion and can enter their space.

It is also appropriate to model concentration for your child by having them see you focused on tasks they can understand and to which they can relate. You can participate in shared experiences with your child that encourages concentration. Activities like peeling an entire potato, rolling, and cutting out cookies with a cookie cutter, making meatballs or emptying all the garbage cans in all of the rooms in your home build both motor skills and concentration, as well as helping your child contribute to the family. These activities also work on many other executive functioning skills that are important for all aspects of a successful school career and a successful life.

Concentration builds over time. Toddlers, Primary, Lower Elementary, and Secondary students will have ever-increasing concentration spans. Nevertheless, we can encourage through modeling ourselves, offering conducive spaces, and sharing experiences that require concentration (both new and repeated) that build concentration.

Purpose Vocabulary Enrichment for 30 months and up

Materials

• 
Brown Construction Paper

• 
Basket

• 
Blue Construction Paper

• 
Land and water items to sort Cardstock

• 
Vehicles: Boats and Cars

• 
Scissors

• 
Animals

• 
Glue . Plants . Laminate (optional)

Preparation

1. Cover the cardstock with ½ blue and ½ brown construction paper.

2. Glue in place.

3. Laminate if desired.

Show Your Child

1. Show your child the laminated land and water mat and the basket of objects.

2.Point to the brown side and say, “this is brown like soil. This represents the land. What are some things we do on land?” Have a short conversation and discuss things like walking, driving, riding bikes…

3. Point to the blue side and say, “This is blue like water. This represents the water.” Continue with a conversation about water and all that we do in the water.

4. Point to the brown again and say, “land.” Point to the blue again and say “water.”

5.Remove one of the objects from the basket and name it. For example, “whale.” Then say, “The whale lives in water,” and place the whale on the blue side of the mat.

6. Repeat with an object for land.

7. Continue to do this with your child until they get the idea. Then allow them to continue the sorting. Give the names of the objects that are new to them.

8. When they are all done, help them to put the basket of objects and mat away on a shelf. Once you show them this activity, they should be free to take it out whenever they have time to play at home.

Note: If your child places an object incorrectly, you do not need to correct them right away. It may take more time and experience for your child to understand how to sort them. If you notice this, at another time, read books about animals that live in water and live on land, or vehicles in the water and vehicles on the land. Then, represent the activity.

    content: `For more than a decade, I’ve watched as parents approach our front entry. As Director of Admissions, I can tell by the looks on our visitors’ faces that our hilltop campus has already made a favorable impression. Within sight of the nearby Blue Ridge mountains, the Montessori School of Westminster’s 27-acre campus assures families that children from age two through Middle School will embrace nature, explore wooded trails, and find friends under wide blue skies while experiencing a quality Montessori education.

We welcome our new Head of School, Lauren Welsh-Baer, the Montessori School of Westminster’s (MSW’s) third in a trio of great women who have led the school for half a century. She is a former student, taught in our Lower Elementary program since 2007, and has her two children attending the school.

Fifty years ago, the area surrounding the school in north-central Maryland was a place where people retreated from the growing city of Baltimore. In 1973, a group of dedicated parents—doctors, attorneys, entrepreneurs, educators, and professors from the nearby liberal arts college—formed the Montessori Society of Westminster to establish a fresh, new preschool dedicated to Montessori ideals. Their efforts created the Montessori School of Westminster.

The Society rented two rooms for the new program in a rural church. The church’s wide lawns, open fields, and even its historic gravestones provided a quiet and fitting setting for a school emphasizing movement for students both indoors and out.

An experienced Montessori guide from Illinois was hired. During the school’s first year in 1973, the school offered morning and afternoon Primary classes for about 50 students. Society members served as school registrar and provided support with marketing, accounting, and fundraising.

As the area population steadily grew, MSW followed in kind. Parents, committed to the Montessori Method, clamored for additional grades, and Elementary programs were added. In 1994, room for the school’s expanded programs was provided by renting space at a second church.

The second location housed the school’s much-anticipated Middle School, which opened in 1999, after the dedicated program guide (a public-school teacher convert) traveled repeatedly between Maryland and Texas to complete her training. Since its inception, students in MSW’s Middle School class have visited cities and landmarks from coast to coast and places in between, experiences that foster independence and encourage students to explore cultures across the globe.

In ensuing years, the surrounding demographic shifted to a bedroom community for those commuting to Baltimore and Washington, D.C. By 2000, after 17 years of operation, about 140 students attended MSW. The school community was surprised when the church housing the Primary program announced it was developing its own school. MSW stakeholders were tasked with quickly finding options for relocating the school.

A downtown Westminster location seemed most advantageous; however, as sites were considered, a 27-acre parcel five minutes from the city center became the choice for construction of a dedicated new building. Excitement grew as space devoted specifically to the Montessori Method was designed. Both the architect and the builder of the school were parents of MSW students. The plan for the new school building included direct outdoor access from each classroom. Low window sills invited sunlight and green landscapes into each room. Kitchenettes, child-sized toilets, and multiple playgrounds were anticipated features of the new campus. The new education building featured clean, modern lines and spacious classrooms designed specifically for the Montessori Method. The first group of students crossed the threshold in September 2001.

As the Montessori School of Westminster celebrates 50 years, in addition to nine classrooms, the school includes a popular program for two-year-olds named Beginnings; the expansive 5,000-square-foot UTZ Field House; a separate Middle School building; outdoor education spaces; expanded playgrounds with updated equipment; before- and after-school care programs; extensive trails, gardens, woods, and a stream that students love to explore. We recently added bus transportation service. Instrumental and choral music, visual arts, language instruction, physical education, and MSW’s one-of-a-kind environmental education program complement our curriculum known for its fidelity to Montessori principles. Our Montessori-certified faculty has a combined 93 years of Montessori teaching experience and almost 150 years in education. MSW is accredited by the American Montessori Society, the Association of Independent Maryland Schools, and is licensed as a Maryland “Green School.”

For two-year-olds through Middle School, MSW instills qualities of mutual respect, independence, creativity, collaboration, and a love of learning. Near-capacity enrollment of 180, including more than a dozen legacy students, suggests we are on the right path as we prepare for the next 50 years!`,

    content: `In a Montessori school, step one is preparing the environment. Teachers spend days, sometimes weeks, preparing their classrooms for the new school year. They consider every student, what they love, what they need, and find a place for that in the room. Everything is arranged in precise sequence and according to the skills being developed. A teacher makes sure anything a child may need is somewhere in that room, and we often learn much about our students by observing what it is that they seek. When everything is in place, we make sure the room is also clean, fresh, beautiful, and enticing. There should be plants, animals, art, and music to create a space of inspiration and peaceful learning.

An advantage to having spent one’s career in a Montessori school is the attention to detail we develop, along with our understanding of child development and how to prepare a beautiful learning environment. My husband, Bruce, and I have Infant/Toddler, Early Childhood, Lower and Upper Elementary Montessori teaching credentials between us and have run our school for 36 years in Park City, Utah. Our grandchildren are now 13, 9, 5, 3 and 9 months. They have all attended our school, and they are all classic Montessori children, which, of course, means they are all different!

When our grandchildren come to our house they get right to work, just as if they were walking into class. Finley likes to bake or build with her uncle’s enormous Lego brick collection, Mara likes to draw and read her mom’s comic books, Luna likes puzzles and games, Elliott likes the trains and Strider likes books and things that roll. They know where all those things are and need no help getting started or putting things away. They can go outside and swing, play on the small beach by the pond or (in the winter) clear a skating path on the pond. We have inadvertently collected skates in every size, since those little grand-feet grow so fast! In the summer we like to ride bikes to the neighborhood pool or to a park for a picnic. If it’s to be a sleepover, forts will be constructed of blankets and pillows, and someone will likely stay up too late – often me!

Of course, when they were all babies, it was trial and error to make sure our environment was properly prepared. We scoured the place for baby dangers and retrofitted every room so the grand ones could reach their cooking, crafting, reading, puzzling and building materials. Yes, there is a rocking horse in the living room, a push car in the family room, a child-sized rocking chair in the office, a unicorn in the bedroom, sand toys on the beach, small rakes, and shovels in the garden. Every part of our home has something for the young ones. Just as we prepare our classrooms as teachers, we plan activities in every part of the house as grandparents so the children can always find something interesting to do. We make sure they can access everything they need and put it all away when they are done. And just like in the classroom, they arrive and get right to work. Which leaves us free to sit down and watch them work. Or join them!

I picked up a child-sized silver tea set in a vintage shop several years ago and that has been a favorite of each of the grandchildren. As soon as they can reach the microwave, they can heat the water, select the tea, fill the sugar bowl and creamer, and place cookies on a small china plate. When they are done, whoever can reach the sink washes all these special dishes and puts them carefully back, ready for the next tea party. Between parties there is the silver to polish and the cookies to bake.

And, sometimes, there is nothing more special than a cousin outing — to the aquarium, the museum, skiing, the pool, the beach, biking, hiking — the world is our classroom.

We have seen how successful these children are in school. They can be just as successful in our homes and on field trips with some thoughtful preparation.

    content: `Practical Life is a fundamental part of the Montessori curriculum. Dr. Maria Montessori wrote, “Education should not just be preparation for university, but preparation for life.” We want our children to have the skills and knowledge to function very well independently: capable of caring for themselves and their environments; knowing how to behave in a manner that will lead them to success in all aspects of their personal, educational, and professional lives. Our responsibility as parents is to help them to be ready for successful, independent living.

In Montessori classrooms, at every level from toddlers to young adults we divide Practical Life into the following areas: Care of Oneself; Care of One’s Environment; Food Preparation; and Grace and Courtesy. Just as at every level in our classrooms children become more and more abstract thinkers and have less need of pre-made materials to demonstrate skills and concepts, so a similar evolution occurs in our homes.

In the early years children work with activities, all very neatly ordered and on the shelves. The activities are specifically designed for them to learn all sorts of Practical Life skills, such as dishwashing; preparing for their own snack; using utensils; and resolving conflicts using their words. The Practical Life area is quite obvious in a Toddler or Early Childhood classroom. In the Elementary years practical life materials are not always designated to an area or grouping of shelves. They tend to be placed around the indoor and outdoor environments where they can be accessed when needed. For example, you may find them in a garden shed, a kitchen area, or at a workbench with cabinets for tools. At the Adolescent level students may be helping with projects in the larger community such as Habitat for Humanity; traveling across town to the public library or the local college to do research; writing their resume and cover letters to set up internships for themselves in local businesses; or designing costumes for a performance.

Throughout their home and school years these kinds of activities are important because they have dual purposes within each activity. The obvious purpose is the skill that they learn from each activity like how to use a dustpan and brush, how to plan and prepare a meal, how to interrupt politely, how to peel and cut bananas, how to get across town on a bus, or how to fold the laundry, etc. The other purpose is what we like to call the “hidden lessons” which are as, or more important than the actual skill attained. These hidden lessons are independence, order, concentration, and coordination.

So when we think about folding laundry, and we observe children doing that activity we can easily see that knowing how to fold it helps them to develop a skill that will allow them to be more independent. At the same time, they are learning to sort and categorize laundry items to create order, to pay attention and carefully fold clothing neatly, and to coordinate their hands and minds as they complete the activity. These are essential skills that apply to many aspects of their adult life. The beauty of it is that children do this work throughout their growing years without being conscious of all that they are learning.

So next time your child tells you about folding the laundry at school, or you watch your child folding and putting laundry away at home, notice the sparkle in their eye and the pride in their work that your children have when they participate in these everyday activities. 

The child who has felt a strong love for his surroundings, and for all living creatures, who has discovered joy and enthusiasm in work, gives us reason to hope that humanity can develop in a new direction.

    content: `Note from the Director: You may notice that this issue of Tomorrow’s Child has articles that reference both the practical and developmental purposes of the lessons in Montessori schools. This uplifting article about a rock band in a Montessori school is no exception. Chad Wilson Bailey could have named this article “What Does a Rock Band Have to Do with It?”. As you read this article you will notice that not only the students but also the musician benefits from the experience. The practical experience of practicing together to gain instrumental skills and vocal presentation, setting up equipment at the venue, and actual performance are obvious and important, no doubt. However, as you read the article and look at the developmental/hidden lessons, you will find that they are enormous. You’ll always find independence, order, concentration, and coordination at the core. Then, if you keep looking, you will see even more lessons, including collaboration, respect, and confidence. Music is an undeniable source of pleasure and learning.

As a professional musician, I never really considered myself to be a teacher. I was made aware of the need for a band director at the school through a parent and mutual friend at Desert Garden Montessori School (DGM). I interviewed for the position and was apprehensive about taking on the role until I met the children and saw the space. I was immediately drawn to them and felt instantly that I needed to take on the opportunity. I quickly realized that there was limited musical equipment with no budget for new equipment. I became worried about how I was going to conduct a rock band program without the items that the students needed. Through generous contributions from the Phoenix community and members of DGM I was able to buy new equipment for the program and, from there, we were off and running.

I started working with the students twice a week for an hour and fifteen minutes for each class. The students quickly brainstormed a list of songs they wanted to learn and began working hard to prepare them for performance. They had a few smaller shows at the DGM campus throughout the semester, but they were shocked when they found out they had been invited to perform for an audience of 250+ teachers at the Montessori Foundation/International Montessori Council Annual Conference held here in Phoenix. They were honored by the gesture and quickly accepted the invitation.

This was almost 4 hours of setting up and taking down equipment and countless hours of practice, but by the end of the day, I would do it 100 times over if I could.

After the performance, I collected some feedback from the students about their experience. Jack, 15 years of age and the drummer of DGM Rock Band, shared, “My favorite moments were when everyone started clapping to the beat of Mr. Brightside, which as a drummer is a huge compliment, and I think I speak for the whole band when I say that having everyone wave their phone lights on This Love was awesome. My favorite moment in the performance was the instrumental solo in You Know I’m no Good. It was almost 4 hours of setting up and taking down equipment and countless hours of practice, but by the end of the day, I would do it 100 times over if I could. I love playing drums and I love our band and I am so looking forward to playing more songs with them in the future.”

Makayla, the bass guitarist of our Rock Band, shared several insights from her experience: “For the past three years that I have been in a rock band, we have only performed in front of our school community, so you could only imagine how exciting performing at an exclusive outside event was for our group. The venue was beautiful, the audience was vibrant, and the music felt perfect. The preparation for concerts is always nerve-wracking for me. My mind constantly twists and turns thinking about the set list, gear, and the overall presence we bring to an event. To my surprise, once our band was on the stage, I felt truly comfortable and confident. All my worries about messing up a note or playing the wrong song left me. It felt amazing just to relax and perform to an audience that didn't know me and to people that I had never met before. I believe that may have been my favorite part of the entire event. The audience was so supportive, and after the show, many of the members sprinkled our band with plenty of compliments that made us feel like celebrities. I am extremely excited for any new adventures our band plans to take on.”

From my perspective, it was exciting for me to guide the students through the event, which was a legitimate gig; a gig that involved an hour of travel time to and from, a large setup, a large crowd of people (from outside of their school site), the performance of multiple songs and even an encore performance! I was beyond proud of the students, their work ethic, their professionalism, and their ability to rise to the occasion.

Going forward, I am hoping to purchase a professional-grade PA system for the school, continue to guide the students through new music and more challenging songs, help students with future performances, and recruit new members into the Rock Band so that we can continue this great program. I feel grateful and blessed to have the opportunity to work at DGM with these incredible students. I have already witnessed so much growth in every member of our Rock Band and I look forward to watching each of these great musicians step into their full potential as artists. My heart is full every day because of them.

    content: `Changing our View of Education: A Positive Approach

The positive nature of the Montessori approach, with its emphasis on process and discovery, is central to why it works so well for children in their development. When Dr. Montessori lectured in London in 1946, she pointed out that conventional education focuses on mistakes.

Think of your own experiences and how your schooling was structured; you will probably remember that there was constant attention given to your errors. Avoiding errors was the thrust of the system. Even with a few enlightened, kind teachers here and there, who emphasized process and exploring bravely, the main message for how you were to learn things was by having your mistakes pointed out to you daily in the form of testing, performing in front of classmates, and reaching for the one “correct” answer to each question. This emphasis, by design, encourages children to lose confidence in their originality. And, yet, we know that developing unique perspectives is invaluable. Thus, the very thing that makes society prosper is being discouraged on a daily basis in our conventional school model.

You may be wondering how there could be another way to teach, when there are certain areas in life where there really is just one correct answer. Mathematics and science are not a matter of opinion, for instance. There are facts that children must learn in order to succeed in some areas. Which is more important: the process, which leaves room for originality, or the answer, which must be consistent with the truth? The answer is both, and Montessori’s approach allows for this interesting dynamic to play out in the classroom, as it does in real science laboratories and in sophisticated math discussions. Dr. Montessori discovered that there is an alternative way that children learn about exact answers.

Montessori’s view was that there is exactness in mathematics and science, which gives our universe balance and beautiful symmetry. Realizing this is truly awe-inspiring for children! But instead of having this phenomenon of exactitude dominate the whole educational approach (by trying to stuff answers into children’s minds), Montessori sought to awaken their wonder for exploration and to help children discover pathways of thinking that lead to correct answers. A prime example of this is the way elementary-aged children explore math through the specially designed materials that require several steps and attention to detail. The children ultimately arrive at the correct answer and are often quite satisfied with themselves after much effort; all the while, they are developing cognitive processes and character traits that contribute to future learning and problem solving.

…the very thing that makes society prosper is being discouraged on a daily basis in our conventional school model.

Discovery and Ownership

Through the materials and how they are presented by the trained teacher, Montessori children in an Elementary classroom search for the paths to find the true answers; when they get there, the results are their own discovery, just as if they were the first mathematicians to discover them. The result of this repeated experience makes children view mathematics as the wonderful puzzle that it is. The idea of being embarrassed at arriving at an incorrect answer is foreign to these children, for whom the taste of finding the right answer is so sweet that they want to explore other avenues and learn more. Mistakes are integral steps in every journey, and this reality becomes familiar and acceptable through repeated experience.

The Montessori materials guide children to find the ways that work, making the adult corrector obsolete in many cases. For instance, when two children do long division problems together with a material called Racks and Tubes, there are many places they might err. They could start off incorrectly by placing the tens board to the right of the units and work through the whole problem incorrectly, only to find at the end that their answer is incorrect (either by bringing it to an older friend who can do the problem longhand on paper, to the teacher who can check it, by using another math material to do the inverse problem and see if it matches, or by checking it themselves against a calculator).

They go back to their work—puzzled—and like two detectives, they re-examine how they set up the problem (which is often when they will identify this first mistake), or they employ a friend to see if they can identify where they may have lost the path. In my experience as a Montessori Elementary teacher, this is when the fun really begins if the adult supports an attitude of curiosity about finding the error.

Children will repeat a problem over and over, sometimes eliminating just one of several mistakes at a time in the same math equation or process. The important thing is for the teacher and community to support the quest to get to the end, so that the children do not fall into a habit of giving up too easily or repeat making the same mistake so many times that it gets ingrained! By keeping tabs on their progress, the teacher can see when to step in and point children in the right direction, perhaps making an observation and/or asking a question: “Oh! Wait, I see—look where your units board is. Do you remember where it belongs?” This is usually all that is needed to get an “Ah-ha!” and a delighted, re-energized effort to try the whole thing again. Children are remarkably resilient, especially when working with a friend and being allowed to own the whole process of the math equation. When they finally, leaning over the calculator with suspense, find that they have achieved the correct answer by their own efforts, it is an excited triumph that feeds the urge to tackle more and more problems.

Very rarely have I seen children want to get to the answer easily so they can quit. There are some who will be tempted to use a calculator to find the answer and just write it in, sometimes several times, to create the illusion that they have accomplished a lot of “work.” You may be surprised to hear that in a Montessori environment, that is the exception and not the norm. Teachers usually catch that pretty quickly, but even if they didn’t, and even if other children did not point to it and demand that the child work honestly and just as hard as them, the child who does this often abandons the practice after watching others glean the internal rewards of sustained efforts and true glory of finally getting that answer.

As children experience this quest again and again, they hone their skills each time. Eventually, the exercise becomes too easy for them, and they are ready to advance to another math process that brings them to their next level of challenge.

Developing Persistence

To describe all the ways children might error in the process of long division with Racks and Tubes would take too long here, but I’ll give you a sense: One child may write the problem down differently than their companion and, therefore, lay out some incorrect amounts when distributing the beads to be used (a mere flipping of two numbers, perhaps). This carelessness will eventually be discovered, and both children will realize the importance of double-checking with each other before they begin. They also might place the working number of beads in the wrong category or confuse the order of the categories (units, tens, hundreds, etc). Again, these are mistakes that reflect the need to double-check their layout before they begin the process.

Another place they may err is in physically dropping a bead or beads, losing them as they spring across the floor and losing count of how many were in the bowl to be distributed. This reminds them to slow down, be careful, and focus on their physical movements. They could also lose count or forget a step if they are interrupted by conversation or stop what they are doing to attend to something else in the middle of their process. This would illustrate the importance of sustaining their focus on the task at hand until finished. Finally, they might write the numbers down in the wrong order at the end, showing again a need for more careful, focused attention and awareness.

Montessori teachers tend to inspire a sense of wonder and nurture children’s curiosity and imagination.

Sometimes, two children have two different answers written down, and they’ll be perplexed about which one is correct, garnering more discussion and a backtracking of their steps. Watching all this is incredible; the amount of teamwork, social interaction, struggle, humor, fun, and agony that can accompany such a process as doing long division is positively brilliant in the sense of integrating all aspects of a child’s development as a person and a mathematician.

For a Montessori teacher, bearing witness to such self-discoveries is joyful. It is a special experience to spend one’s days in an Elementary Montessori classroom with children working with the Racks and Tubes! It can take more than an hour for children to complete a challenging problem (if you account for the self-correcting, they may need to do), but the learning that occurs is immeasurable. And the more children work with such processes, the faster they achieve success each time, fueling their desire to tackle more challenges all over the classroom.

This is just one example of how Montessori fuels the development of children’s resilience and perseverance in a very direct and effective way. And because a Montessori classroom is a vibrant community where everyone is working simultaneously on different things and seeing what others are doing, the practice of pushing oneself until achieving success is contagious. Children will stop and help each other, discuss, and share a conundrum, and sometimes get intrigued with each other’s experiences of learning. The learning is, therefore (in economic terms), a positive externality, meaning that the network of students spreads newfound information via witnessing and sharing experiences; this happens naturally in a Montessori Elementary classroom because of children’s gregarious social behavior at these ages. This is another example of where Dr. Montessori designed an approach that employs (rather than fights against) the developmental characteristics of children in this stage of life between ages six and twelve, specifically, their tendency to be very social and to always want to find out what their peers are doing.

In the above example, students may use the mantras they learned in their Primary years (ages five and six), such as “The units always go on the RIGHT” and “We always begin with the UNITS” (“except in division, when we begin with the highest category present”). Students love these little cues, and when the Primary teacher says them each time, she is with children in a math presentation, the children often chant along. There are just a few such mantras that carry over from Primary to Elementary, so children tend to remember these. We have found that children benefit from having such important points of interest brought to their attention regularly, so that they can commit them to memory.

When working on math and science, the children in a Montessori classroom don’t just value the exactness of a true answer; they love that there are answers to find, and they see each exact answer as a part that connects to a greater whole, creating a universal balance in which each component matters. With the Montessori approach (where the processes of discovery appeal to our children’s developmental characteristics at each age), finding correct answers is fun, sometimes eventful, and always intrinsically rewarding.

    content: `Independent work begins with choice, and choice is a necessary work element for self-development.
Look in a Montessori classroom with twenty or more very busy children between the ages of almost three and six, and you will see children who are passionate about their work. They are focused, self-directed, and persistent. Three-year-old John cuts an apple and then shares apple slices with his friends. Four-year-old Peter traces metal shapes with colored pencils. Five-year-old Sara counts colored wooden squares and then writes numerals on a math paper. When children work with passion, they are curious, creative, inquisitive, imaginative, constructive, thoughtful, orderly, and more. Children love to work. This is how they grow.

Children’s “work” has many meanings.

In a Montessori setting, the word “work” conveys several meanings. Work identifies a learning activity. For example, a food preparation work, a writing work, or a math work. When a child uses a learning activity, he may say, “This is my work.”

Work activities occur during the “work period.” The classroom schedule may include a 2 ½ to 3 hour morning work period. The schedule may also include a shorter afternoon work period. During the work period, children may choose work that is for one child; other works may be used by two or more children. Some works are designed to be used on a table. Other work is used on a floor. Before bringing it to the floor, children will unroll a work rug. The work rug assists the young child with keeping the learning objects together on the rug. The work rug also announces to the other children, “Please walk around my work.”

“Work” also describes a child’s responsibilities for taking care of the work materials. It can happen that a child finishes her work, and then she may decide to go to the shelf and choose another work, another learning activity. The teacher will offer the child a gentle reminder, “Please put your work away before you choose another work.”

Children’s work has both practical and developmental purpose.

“Work” refers to the practical purpose found in each learning activity. For example, a child works with the subtraction strip board and learns a subtraction process. Another child works with the bow-tying dressing frame and learns a bow-tying process. Work has yet another meaning. The child’s process of self-development is also called work. For this reason, we do not interrupt children when they work. They are developing their potential within themselves. The work of the child is to become an adult.

For example, three-year-old Martha transfers dried beans from one bowl to a second with a wooden tong. The practical purpose for this work is to learn to use tongs. The developmental purpose is to learn to concentrate and strengthen and develop hand coordination, a necessary preparation for learning to write when she is older.

Children’s work has several more characteristics.

Several more characteristics describe children engaged in purposeful, self-development work. Children will work independently from others. They become absorbed and concentrate for long periods of time. Children will use learning activities with tremendous repetition; they complete a work task, and then they do it all over again. And they are not concerned about making mistakes; mistakes are children’s recipes for learning.

Children make independent choices when they work.

Remarkably, young children are compelled to engage in activities by themselves. They are not directed by teachers. In the Montessori classroom, a teacher will not do anything for children if they are ready for us to show them how to do it themselves.

Independent work begins with choice, and choice is a necessary work element for self-development. When children make independent choices, they learn to become self-directed and self-disciplined. Children choose their own work. Each child will also choose how to use it and how long to use it. When children choose their own work, they are choosing what they need for their growth and development. They choose what they need to develop their unique potential. Consequently, no two children learn at the same time or in the same way, and each child will only learn when she is ready.

Children who are independent can choose their own work and work with concentration. They can persist, overcome challenges, and self-correct. They have developed habits of learning.

Children develop understanding when they work.

Work with the Montessori materials assists children with developing conceptual understanding. For example, size is an abstract concept. If young children could reason and learn solely with language, we could tell them the meaning of size, and they would understand. Instead, young children are perceptual learners. Young children learn with their senses (sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell) and from what they can do with objects.

Perceptual learners “think” with objects. They understand concepts by arranging and comparing objects. Something is rough because it is not smooth. Something is sweet because it is not sour.

For example, four-year-old Martin arranges a set of ten wooden rods. A practical purpose for this material is to understand length. Each rod is painted in the same red color. The shortest red rod is 10 cm. long; the next is 20 cm. long; and the next rods progress in length by ten more centimeters to the longest red rod which is 100 cm. or 1 meter long. Martin places the red rods randomly on his work rug. He then places two rods side-by-side, compares their lengths, and in this way arranges all ten rods from shortest to longest. Martin now mixes the rods and sorts them by length again. Martin repeats his work with the red rods six times.

Children prefer the process of work and not results.

Children are not result oriented. They are, instead, process oriented, and they are compelled to work with repetition. Children may prefer process because they are not interested in perfection. Perfection is a final state; there is no further growth after becoming perfect. The child’s purpose is to develop his or her unlimited potential, and repetition is how they do this.

For example, two-year-old Beth has been working with an apron for about ten minutes. She puts it on over her head, and then she takes it off. She looks at the apron, turns it sideways, and then puts it on over her head. And then takes it off, and then puts it back on. At any moment an adult could help Beth, but Beth does not ask for help. Apparently, she is not interested in wearing the apron. Beth’s choice is developmental. She is purposefully practicing putting it on and taking it off.

Three-year-old Tommy picks up a pitcher containing red-colored water. Tommy places a funnel into an empty jar, he pours the colored water into the funnel and watches the water drain into the jar. Now he places the funnel into a second jar, pours water into the funnel, and again watches the water drain. Some water spills onto the table. He places the pitcher on the table, picks up a small sponge, wipes the water spill, and squeezes the sponge into the pitcher. He now pours the jar water back into the pitcher. Then he does it all over again, and then again. Tommy busies himself for some 25 minutes with this activity. Sometimes he pours slowly, sometimes quickly, sometimes with the funnel, and sometimes without. The practical purpose of this work is to learn to pour liquids through a funnel and to decide to stop pouring when the jars are filled. The developmental purpose is to develop coordination, concentrate, and make judgments.

Children develop both practical skills and satisfy developmental purposes from repetition and practice. They develop their abilities to concentrate, observe, compare, make decisions, innovate, and more. For example, four-year-old Michelle has been sorting and building with 27 colored blocks already for 15 minutes. The colored blocks make up ten different combinations of sizes and colors. When put together, the blocks form a trinomial cube. Michelle is absorbed. She sorts the blocks by sizes and colors, builds the cube, and then takes it apart. Then she builds the cube all over again, each time beginning with a different block. Perhaps she is fascinated with the size and color patterns; perhaps she is fascinated with how these blocks always come together and form a cube.

Children’s work includes making many mistakes.
Children are mistake oriented; they are not afraid to make many, many mistakes. We should celebrate the necessity of making mistakes because this is how children learn. Their work process is to explore, investigate, make mistakes, discover, and then do It again. For example, learning to pour requires developing eye and hand coordination that prevents spilling. Learning to spell requires developing writing coordination and knowledge of English phonemes that prevent writing pear as pair or writing see as sea.

The Montessori learning materials are designed to guide children to learn to recognize and then self-correct their mistakes. For example, Tammy works with the Knobbed Cylinder Block. The purpose of this material is to learn about size and to develop the ability to reason and make judgments. There are ten cylinders in the block. The ten cylinders are the same length, and they differ in diameter. Each cylinder fits exactly into one hole in the block. Tammy takes out each cylinder and then puts them back into the block. Sometimes she puts cylinders in the wrong places — the cylinders do not fit into the wrong places. Once the cylinders are properly returned, she repeats and does it all over again. Some children will repeat this work process 15, 20, or more times.

Erin builds a block tower, and the tower falls. She tries again, and she stacks the blocks in a different way. The tower falls again. From these building mistakes, Erin gains valuable experiential knowledge about cause and effect, balance, creative problem solving, and the value of learning from trial and error. This work is called the Pink Tower. This is a set of ten cubes, and the cubes are painted in an identical pink color. The cubes are not the same size. They are graded in size from 1 cm3 to 10 cm3. The purpose of this work is for the child to develop an understanding of size. Children develop this understanding with their senses. They hold and see each cube, compare the sizes and weights of each cube, and arrange the cubes in order from largest to smallest or from smallest to largest.

When children work, their repetition guides them to learn how to self-correct. Although the cubes differ in size, the child may place some of the cubes in the wrong size order. Should this happen, the teacher will merely observe and patiently wait and see what the child will do next. Will the child notice the sequence of cubes is not in a size order? Will the child self-correct and rearrange the cubes?

Children’s work differs from adults’ work.

Remarkably, work does not tire children. Instead, they become energized from engaging in work they have chosen. Adults, of course, also work, and we also develop ourselves from our work. For example, we go to the gym and “workout.” We can work to master some knowledge and skills and better ourselves. We also work to produce results. We often work efficiently and effectively to produce the most results we can, in the least amount of time, and with the least amount of effort. We love results, and we feel satisfied when we check it off the list. We adults are motivated to work for intrinsic and extrinsic rewards. We work out at the gym for the benefit of health and strength. And we may work at work for the benefit of a salary.

Children work for the benefit of growing up and becoming adults, and they do this without a contract or promise of salary in exchange for their time and the value they produce. When young children finish an activity, they do not check it off a list. Instead, they may do their work all over again. Children’s work often lacks efficiency and effectiveness. They may make unpredictable movements, and they may make many messes. Unlike an adult, young children do not work with minimal effort. They are “all in!” They love to work! Dr. Maria Montessori described a child’s work process:

[The] child has a personality which he is seeking to expand; he has initiative, he chooses his own work, persists in it, changes it according to his inner needs; he does not shirk effort, he rather goes in search of it, and with great joy overcomes obstacles within his capacity. (Dr. Montessori’s Own Handbook, pp.77- 78.)

For children, work is a continuous process of self-development, and children must work to develop everything: their personalities and walking, running, climbing; understanding and speaking language; socializing and expressing emotions; reasoning and creating; overcoming obstacles and persisting; solving problems, being creative, and more.

Children passionately engage in work because they are passionate to grow and become themselves. When they work, they are scientists, filled with wonder and curiosity. They are intent on investigating the world and developing themselves. They are not afraid to experiment and see what will happen when they try this and then that. For children, it’s all in a day’s work.

    content: `A young child’s receptive language develops sooner than their expressive language. This means they are capable of understanding much more than they can express. Honoring this intellectual development can be difficult when you feel you are constantly met with the one-word answer (“no!”) or a temper tantrum. You may feel like you just asked a simple question, or you just suggested a meal of their favorite food and you look down to find your child flailing on the floor. How did this happen?

Communicating with your young child with respect is what lays the foundation for how they will relate and communicate with others as they get older. Using a calm and clear voice helps them feel your sincerity and honest nature. They look to you for guidance as they build their personality.

Staying calm and clear can be difficult to remember when your young child has dropped to the floor and is crying and neither of you know why. Although this situation may not always be avoidable, often it is. You can prepare for this moment by using clear, honest, and positive communication from the start. That’s right, from the moment they are born, you can start communicating your trust in their development. And it is never too late to start! Children of all ages respond well to positive and honest communication.

Using consistent positive phrasing as your communication style helps your child understand when they have the opportunity for choice and input. Young children often feel everything is decided for them and out of their control. They are newly aware that they have choice, can contribute to family life, and they are seeking autonomy. They express it by saying, “no!” even when they may really want to say yes. We can support them as they learn that their contribution matters and that they truly have an important voice by not putting them in a situation where they can say no. We can invite them to participate in community life whenever possible and set them up for seeing their role as a contributor not a bystander.

Whenever possible, give your child a choice of two options: “Would you like to walk around the block or play in the backyard?” “Would you like to wear brown pants or blue pants?” These are moments where they feel a sense of control and that build their trust in your relationship. This foundation of trust allows you to make the bigger decisions with their cooperation (and without tantrums). “I will give you one more push on the swing and then we are leaving the park,” rather than, “Are you ready to leave?”

Below is a chart of seven common situations with young children. By changing just a few words you may find that your young child is much more cooperative and engaged in family life. And you may even see fewer tantrums!

I always get excited when the new year comes around. It’s such an adventure since we have no way to see exactly what is in store for us in our relationships, our work, or our world. One thing we do know for sure in life — change is inevitable.

This year, as every year, we will see and experience change, which will cause us and others around us to react or respond in different ways. Our children need us to help them learn to navigate changes in their lives.

Over 20 years ago, Dr. Spencer Johnson wrote a little book called Who Moved My Cheese? In this story, each of the four characters handles change in different ways.

• Those who look for change and get prepared;

• Those who spring into action and incorporate the necessary change into their routine;

• Those who don’t expect it and are frightened into inaction for a while. Eventually, they overcome their fear, let go, and get going;

• Those who are stuck in the comfort of the known and are left behind.

Since change is inevitable, here are a few ways to support our children as changes occur:

• Give them a warning. Life is dynamic. It never stays the same. Let them know that so they are not surprised when changes happen.

• Remember that you are their model for how to deal with change.

• Talk about and explore feelings about change: fear, excitement, frustration, adventure, challenge, anger, and pleasure. Let them know that those feelings are natural.

• Support their effort in dealing with new situations, their progress in developing coping skills, and their positive attitude and creativity.

I hope these tips help now and throughout the new year.

Our friend and author Andrew Newman has added another bedtime book to the collection, including Snuggle Breathing. This is a lovely story for just before going to sleep about the power of hugs to help ourselves and others stay disentangled from negative thoughts. It also reminds us that hugs have a ripple effect in our families and throughout the world.

This whole series by Andrew is filled with books that help children fill their minds with positive, warm emotions when they are getting ready for a peaceful night’s sleep. They are available from www. consciousstories.com.`,

This is a wonderfully fun, imaginative story of getting cleaned up! The illustrations are very colorful and fanciful! They make cleaning up a joyful adventure rather than drudgery. Pat Prisk shows (down in the corner of each page) the steps to washing hands. She then reinforces the process by putting each of the steps to handwashing on one page at the end of the book. She also includes ideas for parents, caregivers, and other adults involved in caring for children. I think youngsters 2 to 7 years old will love this book.`,

This book is a paperback booklet originally created to fill a need in the author’s school. She found that parents were interested in knowing more about their child’s classroom experience. Her idea was to share information about the basic principles of a Montessori classroom and the activities within the 3–6-year-old (Early Childhood) classroom.

Ms. Lundberg briefly describes each curriculum area and then some of the key lessons in those areas. She has included photos of the materials along with their descriptions. She has also added a short biography of Dr. Montessori and some ideas for the home.

This is a great little tool to get parents started in their knowledge and understanding of Montessori at the Early Childhood level. You can purchase this booklet at amazon.com.`,

Ivan’s parents split up and are living in separate houses. Ivan didn’t like that he had to go here and there. He didn’t think he could be happy and himself with his parents apart. It took a little time and some adjustment for Ivan to realize that love and happiness could be shared; that love and happiness could be both here and there. It’s important for children to know that families can change and be structured in different ways. Time helps. Love helps. And some things will be held in common here and there.`,

Illustrated by Iris Villarrubia

Parents will find this book to be a quick and easy reference for everyday living practices with their child. Gavin McCormack has boiled down one-hundred ideas that are in alignment with Montessori philosophy for parents. The ideas are mainly for elementary-age children, and some are for children in the early childhood stage. Then some ideas can be used with children from early childhood through the elementary years and beyond. A few examples are: “Give your child the responsibility to take care of their things.” “Spend one night per week walking and talking. Look at the moon and discuss big-picture ideas.” “Do not replace things that get broken. Learn the value of money and repair things together.”

On each page, the author writes the main idea and then explains the value of practicing it with your child, the family, or the larger community outside your family. Each idea has a two-page spread with an illustration on one page and the idea and value on the other. The illustrations are in color and in a style similar to what a child might draw.

Parents may appreciate the brevity of the content in this book, as life can get so full and time is precious. It can be found on most online booksellers.`,

This is a little board book for your infant or toddler. There is one quite realistic, colorful picture and one word on each page. Pages that are opposite each other in the book are opposite sizes. As you read this book together, your child will increase their vocabulary as you identify the picture images and begin to get some sense that there is a difference in the sizes of things. This is a difficult concept for a little one to really understand from a two-dimensional picture. However, you can put together an activity using objects that show the same concept in a three-dimensional way. For example: a big ball and a small ball; a big spoon and a small spoon; a big stuffed animal and a small stuffed animal; etc. Have fun reading this with your child!`,

    content: `Written by Karen S. Robbins

I was pleasantly surprised when I opened this book for young children. I was expecting a book that has too much to sort out on a page, is visually distracting for young children, and could easily be torn or damaged by accident.

The author of Think Circles! isolates each illustration on the pages to answer the hint. For example: On page 1, the hint is “Bouncing Circle” and the question is “What can it be?” On the opposite page, there is a hidden object with just one opening to view part of the pictured answer with the word, “Think.” Adults get to have fun with this, too, as they read the words to the child and maybe, if needed, add another hint to play along with “thinking” about what the hidden object might be. I love that she invites the child to “think.”

Ms. Robbins also adds in another level of difficulty by adding objects to each page. So, on page 1, there is just one hidden object. On page 2 there are two hidden objects. On page 3 there are three objects, and so on to 10. On each page, there are the corresponding openings, so that children can count the openings and then count the objects when they open the flap to see the answer.

As a teacher, I would present one concept at a time. I would either introduce the book as a problem-solving lesson or as a counting lesson but not both at the same time. Both concepts are higher-level thinking. Either could be presented first. I would probably introduce the “thinking” concept first just because I like it.

The pages are quite sturdy, so that young children can use these books without accidentally damaging the books, assuming the adult has given the child a lesson on carefully turning/opening pages in a book. That’s important since we want children to be successful as they use books and other activities. The illustrations are colorful, attractive, and quite realistic.

There are two other books in this series – Think Triangles! and Think Squares! These books would be enjoyed by children 3-6 years old.`,

Illustrated by Rachael Brunson

Karen Robbins has written two sturdy books for two- to four-year-old’s about animals: Think Farm Animals and Think Zoo Animals. The pages can be easily turned, and the flaps easily opened by young hands. The illustrations are colorful, visually pleasing, and realistic.

Each book is set up similarly with a hint and a question on the left page and an opening that allows the child to see part of the animal on the right page.

For example: In the Farm Animals book on the left page, it reads, “I have a swishy tail and say ‘Moo!’ What can I be?” And on the right page, an opening shows a white and black tail with the word “Think” written below. I love that!

Remember children at this young age are still developing impulse control. The adult can help them with that in a fun way by saying something like, “Hmmmm. I’m ‘thinking’ about animals on a farm. Do we know a song about that? ‘With a moo-moo here and a moo-moo there.’ What could it be?” All the while holding the flap closed as the adult and child “think” together. You could even say to the child, “Let’s keep the flap closed so that we can ‘think’ for a minute.”

Lovely books for young children. I wish there were more!`,

Elementary and middle school children, along with their parents and teachers, will love this book. It is a hilarious review of wild animals from around the world! Each animal is rated in a humorous way that tells the reader a little something about the creatures. Animals Reviewed also includes the common name for the animal, its scientific name, and a zoo or aquarium where it can be found. This information is great because some of these animals may tickle a child’s curiosity and may motivate them to do more in-depth research about the animal. They may even be able to go see the animal in person if a zoo or aquarium nearby has one in residence. Enjoy!`,

Another wonderful book for adventurous children and grown ups who want to have fun making music! The book is laid out in categories starting with Beginning Notes (pun intended I’m sure!); Household Things that Ring and Ping; Body Music; Percussion Beats and Rhythms; Breath Music: the Winds, The String Section; Instruments from the Workshop; and Creating Music. I’m excited just writing down the names of the sections and that’s not all. This book has beautiful photos of real children in action and having so much fun with music. Make Music is a great resource for an afterschool studio or for the vacation home or cabin, or at home on a school break, or ongoing project. The audience for the projects would probably be elementary-age children because of their skill and social levels; although, very clever teachers or parents could probably modify some of the projects for younger children as well.`,

The Memory Box is a very helpful book for children who have lost a loved one. It brings to light a variety of emotions from fear to sadness to happiness that children may experience as they go through the grief process and beyond. Sometimes, adults find it difficult to talk about feelings and death, especially if the person who has died is someone they loved as well. This book helps adults, as it tells a story about a child who is grieving, what feelings she experiences, and how she creates a “memory box.” The illustrations are lovely, almost whimsical, and yet realistic. At the end of the book there is a section to help adults support children through their loss. Children four years old through elementary and possibly the middle school years would benefit from The Memory Box.`,

Illustrated by Hiyoko Imai

When I looked at the cover of this book I was intrigued. It was simple with a kind of unique illustration of a shelf with activities, and it was written for parents of toddlers—encouraging signs. Then I looked at the table of contents which was 3.33 pages long. Hmmm. Busy parents with small toddlers. Looks a little off-putting to me. So, I flipped through the book. I like photos and illustrations. There were very few photos and quite a few illustrations, but lots of words to read in this 248- page volume. Oh boy!

I made myself look more closely, and what I found was delightfully appealing. That huge table of contents I discovered was because the author listed each topic in each chapter, so it looked a lot more daunting than it truly is. Many of the topics listed are half a page to two pages at most. A parent can easily read a quick snippet and put the book down. They can also easily look up a specific topic that they are interested in because the topics are listed in such detail.

After looking more carefully, I really like the design. Simone Davies is very thorough. Her knowledge, understanding, and enjoyment of this age group is very apparent, and she shares it well with her audience. Often toddlers are misunderstood and so behave in ways that parents find difficult. Davies touches on some key points when thinking about toddlers. The first two chapters give parents valuable information about this stage in a child’s development and a brief introduction to Montessori. The rest of the book helps parents see their role as changing from a servant during infancy to a guide during toddlerhood and beyond. She brilliantly describes how to create a home environment that supports toddler success, both physically and emotionally, with furnishings and activities, as well as discipline.

The Montessori Toddler is a great resource for parents of infants, so that they can prepare for toddlerhood and for parents of toddlers who are already in the midst of toddlerhood.`,

    content: `Written by Laura Wilhelm Photos by Gryphon House and Shutterstock

Treasure basket exploration is a terrific idea for not-yet-mobile infants. The concept could be modified in some ways to better fit toddler’s through kindergartener’s strong sense of order. I struggled a little bit with this concept because I know from my own observations, as well as those of Maria Montessori and interactions with children in the early childhood years (birth-6 years old), that this period of time in a child’s development is crucial for preparing an environment that instills a very orderly way of thinking. At the infant and toddler stage of development, little ones are all about moving and exploring, so the baskets work well. There is a certain amount of order to it because the objects are contained within the basket. They come out of the basket and, when finished, return to the basket (sometimes by the infant or toddler—more often than not by the parent or teacher). The baskets are almost like introductory work for the primary level (3-6 years old), where the activities are contained in baskets or on trays but are designed to teach a skill rather than just allow for exploration.

I need to do more research about “heuristic learning” to truly understand what it is. As I read this book, it sounds like you put a bunch of stuff in a pile and the children get to “explore” it. For me it sounds a bit too unstructured for 3-6-year-olds, as they are really ready for order and imitation rather strictly exploration. Their activities always have some flexibility for exploration but also have a beginning, a middle, and end within each activity.

So, there are some very usable ideas for the infant-toddler years, and some ideas that can be modified for older children in Treasure Basket Exploration.`,

Eve Bunting is not new to writing children’s picture books, storybooks, and children’s novels. Blackwater will engage readers from ages 11-14 years old with a story of tragedy, mystery, and moral dilemmas.

It reminds readers of the importance of always being mindful of the choices they make and the actions that they take. Sometimes, even just a simple act of jealousy or revenge can lead to tragedy and can ruin a person’s life or worse. In this story an entire town was affected by the sudden death of two teens and the unspoken truth about the incident.

Brodie, the main character of the novel, struggled with guilt, grief, and truth telling because of his part in the accidental deaths of two of his peers. Fortunately, a good friend encouraged Brodie to confess his actions. When he did, his parents stood by his side as he suffered the consequences of his actions.

This is a book that parents, and teachers will want to read along with their teens to openly discuss the choices that were made and the events that occurred. Guiding children through the teen years and allowing space for them to express opinions and wrestle with tough decisions is an important part of our role in parenting and teaching. Expressing our own values in a non-defensive or non-judgmental way, while creating that space, is the key to helping our teens process real life situations.`,

Illustrated by Noah Z. Jones

As children grow into the elementary years and beyond, they are often influenced by the media and their peers. They want to fit in with the other kids in their schools and neighborhoods.

This story is set in a city but could be any setting whether urban, rural, or suburban. The main character, Jeremy, sees that many of his peers are all getting a particular type of shoe and are feeling very cool about it. One day his shoes fall apart at school, and the counselor gives him a pair of shoes, but Jeremy is embarrassed. When the other boys see the shoes, they laugh at him.

His grandmother says that what he really needs is a new pair of snow boots, but Jeremy really wants to have a pair of “those shoes.”

After much searching from one thrift store to another, Jeremy finds a pair of “those shoes.” He pays for them himself, even though he knows they are too small for him. Find out what Jeremy finally decides to do with “those shoes” at the end.

The illustrations are vibrant with color and movement. The style reminds me of the style of Ezra Jack Keats. Elementary children will enjoy this book, and it may serve as a conversation starter about Jeremy and the choices that he makes.`,

Photography by Abelardo Morell

Whether this is your first newborn or your fourth, this book has a lot to offer. It will stimulate your awareness of how much and how often babies are speaking to us, if we would only listen. More than anything else, Dr. Nugent is calling us to slow down and pay attention to all the ways that newborns and infants communicate with us without using a word.

These little, tiny humans, new to the world, are ready, willing, and able to express themselves, if we not only take the time to be present but also begin to understand their language. They are awesome!

The photographs beautifully connect Dr. Nugent’s written words with the innocence, the emotions, and the sheer wonder of these small beings! Buy this book for yourself or give it to someone you know. You’ll be glad you did.`,

This children’s book encourages children to feel their own feelings, think their own thoughts, self-reflect, know themselves, be courageous, and accept others for who they are. The overall belief is that humans inherently know who they were meant to be when left unjudged and unconditionally loved. Within this book, the story is written in English and then repeated in Spanish – two books in one. The illustrations are colorful and fun. They depict children from many backgrounds.

At the end of the book, there are several pages with notes to parents, caregivers, and teachers with discussion questions and activities. This book would be appealing to three- to eight year-old children. It can be purchased at amazon.com and other book outlets.`,

Illustrated by Gülce Baycik

This series is written by an author who we have heard from before. Dr. Owen also wrote a series called Right Now. Some of you may remember and have read those books. Everyone Feels is a new series that can help children identify feelings, such as anger, sadness, and anxiety and give them strategies to cope with them in appropriate, healthy ways. Strategies include deep breathing, changing their thoughts, physical exercise, etc. In the past, children were taught to “stuff” certain feelings and pretend they didn’t exist. Fortunately for all of us, we now know that “stuffing” only leads to eventual explosions that can negatively impact the person with the feeling and others around them.

This series is very helpful for young children as they learn how to self-regulate and express themselves in ways that keep them emotionally safe and healthy. It would be a good addition to any home or school library for children three to ten years old. The books can be purchased online or at a local bookstore.`,

    content: "Real-life reflections for parents walking the Montessori path\n\nParenting small children can feel like navigating a fog. The days are long, the nights are short, and your mind is cluttered with questions you didn’t know you’d be asking: Should she be talking more? Why is he still having tantrums? Are we too strict? Too lenient? What’s normal? What’s best?\n\nMontessori doesn’t hand you all the answers, but it does offer something just as powerful—a lens. A way of seeing. And for many overwhelmed parents, that’s exactly what they need.\n\nWhen you begin to understand Montessori, you find yourself breathing a little easier. This isn’t a trendy method that requires you to throw out your furniture or memorize scripts. It’s a way of tuning into your child’s development, seeing who they really are and what they truly need—and letting go of the pressure to force growth that isn’t ready to happen.\n\nYou stop asking, “Why isn’t she reading yet?” and begin noticing how she studies letters on the cereal box, asks about the sounds in her name, and joyfully pretends to be the teacher reading a story aloud to her stuffed animals. You realize she’s absorbing everything, even when it’s not measurable on a chart.\n\nIn the early childhood years, this shift is subtle but profound. A parent might find themselves rearranging a corner of the kitchen so that their three-year-old can reach their own dishes, learning to pour water from a small pitcher, and taking part in preparing their snack. It’s not about making your home look like a classroom. It’s about inviting your child into real life in ways that feel natural and affirming for both of you.\n\nA Montessori home doesn’t need to be minimalist or magazine-perfect. It just needs to function in a way that says to the child, “You belong here. You’re capable.” Low hooks for a coat. A little basket of socks by the door. Fewer toys, but ones that invite deep play. Predictable routines that create calm instead of chaos. These are the kinds of quiet adjustments that bring surprising peace to a household.\n\nAs the fog begins to clear, many parents find that they begin watching their children differently. Instead of correcting or rushing in, they pause. They observe. They start to notice the concentration in their toddler’s face as she buttons her sweater, or the quiet determination of their preschooler trying to sweep a spill without being asked. They begin to trust that their child is learning all the time—even in moments that look messy or slow.\n\nThere’s a relief in letting go of the race. Montessori parents often find themselves resisting the pressure to overschedule, to push early academics, or to compare. They start to protect unhurried time. They linger at the park. They choose books over apps. They spend more time in conversation and less in correction. Slowly, the parenting experience becomes less about managing behavior and more about building a relationship.\n\nOf course, this doesn’t mean everything is smooth. There are still meltdowns. Still piles of laundry and sibling squabbles. Montessori doesn’t promise a perfect child—it just helps you see the challenges with clearer eyes. When you know that tantrums are part of healthy emotional growth, you don’t take them quite so personally. When you see that independence is built through repeated effort, you stop rushing to tie every shoe or pack every lunch.\n\nFor those who have chosen to send their child to a Montessori school, the experience deepens even further. The philosophy of the classroom begins to echo at home. Parents hear their children using phrases like “I’m working” or “Can I have a turn?” They see their child choosing to set the table, folding napkins carefully, or explaining the life cycle of a butterfly with quiet authority. And instead of wondering where this self-discipline or inner calm came from, they begin to understand that it was there all along—just waiting to be nurtured.\n\nMontessori is not a quick fix. It’s not a method you try for a week and judge by results. It’s a path you walk slowly, thoughtfully, with as much grace for yourself as for your child. It teaches you to focus on process rather than product, and to see effort as more important than outcome. Your child may pour water and spill it a hundred times, but each time, their hands grow steadier. Their confidence grows stronger. And so does yours.\n\nFor many parents, the greatest gift of Montessori isn’t a better-behaved child. It’s the clarity that comes from knowing what matters most: connection, rhythm, trust, and presence. When you embrace this, parenting shifts from something you’re trying to survive to something you’re learning to live—moment by imperfect, beautiful moment.",

    title: "Montessori Homeschool vs a Montessori School",
    slug: "montessori-homeschool-vs-a-montessori-school",
    content: "Parents who choose to use Montessori to homeschool and parents who send their children to a Montessori school like ours are following a similar path.\n\nWhile their environments, schedules, and supports may look different, both sets of parents are inspired by the same vision: to raise children who are curious, independent, capable, and connected to the world around them. Montessori offers a philosophy, not just a curriculum, and that philosophy can guide learning both at home and in a school setting.\n\nStill, it’s worth exploring the strengths, challenges, and motivations of each path—and what unites them at the core.\n\nMontessori Homeschooling: Flexibility, Family, and Deep Connection\n\nParents who choose to homeschool the Montessori way often do so because they value time together as a family. For many, it’s not a rejection of professional educators or social opportunities, but rather a choice to prioritize the bond between parent and child. In a homeschool environment, parents can closely observe their children, follow their individual pace of development, and cultivate a home rhythm that reflects their unique family values.\n\nSome families participate in Montessori co-ops or parent-led learning groups to ensure their children have social experiences beyond the home. Others create close-knit communities through shared homeschooling networks. They may fully understand the trade-offs—fewer materials, less outside input, fewer chances for peer collaboration—but feel that the intimacy, trust, and continuity of homeschooling more than compensate.\n\nFinancially, homeschooling may also be a practical necessity. High-quality Montessori schools can be costly, and for families with two or more children, tuition may exceed the income a parent could earn by returning to the workforce. For some, choosing to stay home is both a philosophical and an economic decision.\n\nMontessori Schools: Expertise, Socialization, and Structure\n\nParents who choose Montessori schools often do so for a different but equally valid set of reasons. Many are working professionals who want their children to be in a nurturing, thoughtfully designed environment during the day while they pursue their careers. These parents may deeply value being part of their child’s life but also recognize that they thrive when working in a professional community with other adults.\n\nMontessori schools offer structured opportunities for social learning, exposure to peers of various ages, and the leadership of trained educators who bring objectivity, developmental knowledge, and years of experience. In these classrooms, children benefit not only from the prepared environment and carefully sequenced materials but also from teachers who understand subtle developmental cues and can respond in ways that support long-term growth.\n\nMany parents also find reassurance in partnering with professionals who bring insight and perspective they may not have. It’s not about abdicating responsibility, but about recognizing the value of collaborative care—trusting that trained Montessori guides can work alongside the family to nurture the whole child.\n\nThe Common Ground: Prepared Adults and Trust in the Child\n\nRegardless of which path a family chooses, success in Montessori education depends less on the setting and more on the mindset of the adults involved. Both homeschooling and school-based parents are called to prepare themselves: to observe rather than control, to guide rather than direct, and to trust rather than rush.\n\nMontessori parents—whether at home or partnering with a school—learn to slow down, simplify, and create meaningful opportunities for their children to act with purpose. They cultivate an environment of respect, order, and beauty. They resist the impulse to over-schedule or micromanage, instead inviting children to engage with real work and follow their curiosity.\n\nMany families blend the two approaches. A school-based Montessori parent may create a home life filled with independence and practical life activities. A homeschooling parent may seek out community groups, Montessori co-ops, or part-time programs to offer social interaction. The lines are often softer than we imagine.\n\nConclusion: Two Roads, One Vision\n\nSo are Montessori homeschoolers and Montessori school parents following the same path? Not quite—but they are certainly moving in the same direction. Both want their children to become confident, joyful, lifelong learners. Both believe in the dignity of childhood. And both recognize that education is not something we do to children, but something we support in partnership with them.\n\nIn the end, it’s not about choosing the “right” way to do Montessori. It’s about committing to the work of presence, patience, and preparation—whether that happens in a classroom or at your kitchen table.",

    slug: "you-dont-have-to-be-a-teacher-to-bring-montessori-home",
    content: "A common worry I hear from parents is: “I love Montessori, but I’m not a trained teacher.” It’s a real concern, especially for parents of toddlers and young preschoolers just discovering the Montessori approach. But let me be clear—you don’t need a credential to bring Montessori into your home. What you need is a curious spirit, a respectful relationship with your child, and a willingness to slow down and be present.\n\nMontessori at home doesn’t require you to recreate a classroom. You don’t need specialized training or a room full of wooden materials. The real magic happens in the everyday moments—in the rhythm of daily life, where your child learns by doing, by observing you, and by participating in the meaningful work of your home.\n\nPicture a mixed-race couple in their bright kitchen, sunlight pouring in through the windows. Their three-year-old daughter stands on a wooden learning tower, stirring batter in a bowl while her father holds it steady. Her mother is nearby, placing muffin tins on the counter and chatting gently about what they’re baking. This is Montessori at home. It’s not about lesson plans. It’s about inviting your child to be part of your world, to do real things with real tools, and to feel capable and trusted.\n\nChildren between the ages of one and a half and four are in a powerful stage of development. They crave participation and purpose. In Montessori, we honor this by including them in the real work of daily life. Helping with breakfast, watering plants, sorting socks, brushing the dog, or cleaning up a spill—these are all learning opportunities. They build fine motor skills, coordination, and—most importantly—confidence. Children begin to feel that they matter. That they can do things for themselves. That they are not just observers in the family—they are participants.\n\nWe often underestimate what young children are capable of. But if you slow down and invite them in, they will surprise you. A toddler can carry their own plate to the sink. A three-year-old can help fold napkins or dust a shelf. It may take longer, and it may not be perfect, but that’s not the point. What matters is that the child begins to see themselves as competent.\n\nMontessori also teaches children to follow a process. When we give them time and space to work through a task—whether it’s slicing a banana or cleaning up spilled water—they develop executive function skills that will serve them for life. They learn to plan, to concentrate, to finish what they start. These early experiences lay the foundation for attention, memory, and self-control.\n\nAnd beyond skills, there’s something even deeper being nurtured: the child’s sense of self. When a child contributes to their home—not because they are told to, but because they want to—they feel dignity. They feel belonging. And they begin to understand what it means to be part of a community.\n\nThat’s the real work of Montessori at home. It’s not about educational outcomes or hitting milestones. It’s about building strong relationships within the family and giving your child a sense of purpose and pride. When your child is invited to help wash vegetables for dinner, or put on their own shoes, or carry a basket of clean laundry, they are learning responsibility, independence, and grace.\n\nWe want to encourage parents to let go of busywork and worksheets and instead embrace the richness of real life. A worksheet may keep a child occupied, but it doesn’t nurture their spirit. It doesn’t build connection. It doesn’t say, “You belong here.” The daily tasks of the home do. And that’s the heart of Montessori.\n\nYou don’t have to do it all at once. You don’t need to be perfect. You just need to begin. Start by slowing down. Watch what your child is drawn to. Invite them into your world. Let them mix the pancake batter, match socks, and scrub potatoes. Be patient. Be present. And trust that these small acts—done together with love—are building something powerful.\n\nNo, you don’t have to be a teacher to bring Montessori home. You just have to be a parent who believes in your child and values the time you spend together. And when you do, your home becomes more than just a place of shelter. It becomes a place of learning, of growth, of joyful connection—and a space where independence, grace, and belonging quietly take root.",

    title: "At Home: Building Confidence Without a Classroom",
    slug: "at-home-building-confidence-without-a-classroom",
    content: "You don’t need shelves of wooden materials to raise an independent, self-assured child. Confidence isn’t born from curriculum or credentials. It grows, steadily and quietly, in the everyday moments that shape a child’s sense of self. Montessori understood this deeply. Her insights weren’t just for classrooms. They were rooted in a vision of the child as a capable, worthy person who grows best when given space to try, to fail, to repeat, and to master.\n\nAt home, confidence develops through rhythm, through rituals, and most of all, through trust. When we create an environment where children know what to expect, where they are included in meaningful ways, and where their efforts are respected, they begin to carry themselves differently. Their eyes light up when they pour their own water, button their own coat, or carry a grocery bag that’s just the right size for them.\n\nFor families with young children—especially those between one and a half and four—this is a golden time to lay the foundation. Parents considering Montessori school or already enrolled often ask what they can do at home to support their child’s confidence. The answer doesn’t lie in flashcards or academic drills. It’s far more personal, grounded in the way we live day-to-day with our children.\n\nImagine a three-year-old waking up to a calm, predictable morning. They know where to find their clothes, because the drawer is organized just for them. They get dressed themselves—not perfectly, but with pride. They sit at a small table and help pour their cereal. Later, they help sweep up a few crumbs from the floor. No one hovers or corrects. Their parents smile, say thank you, and move on with the day. These aren’t just chores. These are moments of identity-building.\n\nLater in the day, the same child helps her father wash apples for a snack. She uses a small sponge and carefully scrubs them one by one. He doesn’t interrupt. He watches. She finishes and lines them up neatly on a towel to dry. It may take longer than if he had done it himself, but that isn’t the point. The child is learning that her work has value—that she can be trusted to contribute.\n\nIn another home, a child helps prepare for guests. Her mother shows her how to fold napkins and arrange small vases of flowers. The child feels important, not just entertained. She isn’t sent away to play while the adults prepare—she’s included. Her small hands may not fold the napkins perfectly, but the pride in her eyes says it all. She has done real work. She has been part of something meaningful.\n\nMontessori emphasizes “freedom within limits.” At home, that can look like giving your child choices within a structured rhythm. You might invite them to help decide what vegetables to buy for dinner. They may choose between two outfits or decide which book to read at bedtime. But the boundaries remain clear and calm. Lunch is at noon. Toys are put away before bed. Trust and consistency become the backdrop against which a child can take risks and grow.\n\nWhat we’re offering isn’t just independence—it’s responsibility. And responsibility is what makes independence meaningful. When a child waters the plants, helps feed the dog, or puts away clean silverware, they’re not just learning skills. They’re participating in the real life of the family. They see their actions make a difference. That deepens their connection to the people around them and strengthens their sense of purpose.\n\nConfidence also blooms when we let our children struggle a little. It’s tempting to zip their coat or pour their juice when they fumble. But every time we rush in, we rob them of a chance to discover their own competence. Montessori adults observe, wait, and only help when needed. At home, this can feel countercultural. But when we pause—just for a few seconds longer—we often find that our children can do more than we imagined.\n\nIn a home where confidence is nurtured, you’ll hear phrases like “Would you like to try?” and “Show me how you do it.” You’ll see toddlers carrying their own backpacks, putting away their own shoes, and slicing bananas with a child-safe knife. Not because someone forced them to, but because they’ve been invited to contribute from an early age. These acts, repeated day after day, build the kind of quiet confidence that lasts a lifetime.\n\nFor parents already in Montessori schools, extending this approach into home life reinforces what children experience during the day. It helps create a seamless sense of identity. At school, they are trusted. At home, they are too. At school, they contribute. At home, they are invited to do the same.\n\nFor those just beginning their Montessori journey, it’s encouraging to know that you can begin now. No special training, no special materials—just a shift in perspective. Trust your child. Invite them in. Give them space and time. Let them pour, sweep, dress, water, stir, scrub, fold, and carry. Let them feel the dignity of work and the pride of persistence.\n\nIn this, confidence doesn’t arrive all at once. It builds over time, through dozens of small acts. And eventually, you’ll see it in the way your child stands taller, walks with purpose, and meets the world with open, eager eyes—not because someone told them they were capable, but because they discovered it for themselves.",

    title: "Keeping Respect at the Center—Even in Emotional Storms",
    slug: "keeping-respect-at-the-center-even-in-emotional-storms",
    content: "Tantrums, sibling rivalry, emotional overwhelm—these are real, and they’re hard. Any parent of a toddler or preschooler knows the sting of a grocery store meltdown or the tension of a fight between young siblings over the same toy for the third time that morning. These are not easy moments. But they’re also not unusual. In fact, they are an expected part of early childhood development.\n\nMontessori offers a powerful reminder: your child is not giving you a hard time—they’re having a hard time. There’s a world of difference between the two. When we remember this, we can meet our children with empathy and respect, even when emotions run high. Respect doesn’t mean giving in or becoming permissive. It means staying calm, offering connection, and holding boundaries with love.\n\nImagine a three-year-old who just lost it because her banana broke in half. She’s crying, she’s screaming, and maybe even kicking the floor. It’s tempting to snap back or try to fix it immediately—perhaps by offering a new banana or telling her to calm down. But Montessori teaches us to pause. To observe. To consider what’s really happening. The child isn’t being difficult—she’s experiencing a loss of control. She had an expectation, and it didn’t go the way she imagined. In that moment, she needs understanding, not correction.\n\nWhat might respect look like here? A parent could kneel down to the child’s level, take a breath, and say softly, “I see you’re really upset about the banana. You wanted it to stay whole. It’s hard when things don’t go the way we hoped.” They don’t need to fix the banana. They don’t need to distract. They just need to be present, to acknowledge the feeling, and allow space for the storm to pass.\n\nMontessori classrooms operate on this same principle. Guides don’t scold children for feeling big emotions. Instead, they offer support through calm presence and consistent expectations. They model self-regulation by remaining grounded themselves. And they help children learn to express what they feel in ways that build connection rather than rupture.\n\nAt home, this can be more difficult, especially when we’re tired, stressed, or overwhelmed ourselves. But it’s in these moments that Montessori can be most transformative. When we keep respect at the center of our parenting, we begin to see that discipline isn’t about control. It’s about guidance. It’s about helping children develop the tools to handle their emotions with growing maturity.\n\nConsider a moment of sibling rivalry. One child grabs a toy, the other hits. You’re in the kitchen, trying to finish dinner. It’s easy to yell. But what would respect look like here? Perhaps it’s taking both children aside and calmly stating, “I see you both want to use this toy. Hitting hurts. We need to find another way.” Maybe you offer each child a turn with a timer, or help them come up with a new game to play together. The goal isn’t punishment—it’s connection, learning, and repair.\n\nChildren learn emotional regulation by watching us. If we yell, they learn to yell. If we shut down, they learn to do the same. But if we breathe, stay calm, and treat them with dignity even when they’re dysregulated, they begin to absorb those tools too. Over time, the child who once screamed over a broken banana may learn to take a deep breath and say, “I’m mad.” And that is a victory worth celebrating.\n\nIt’s important to acknowledge that respect takes practice. We won’t always get it right. We’ll lose our tempers, raise our voices, or say something we regret. But Montessori isn’t about perfection. It’s about awareness, reflection, and growth—for adults as much as for children. Every hard moment is an opportunity to model grace, to reconnect, and to repair.\n\nFor parents considering or already enrolled in Montessori schools, this approach to discipline might feel different from what they experienced growing up. It may even feel unfamiliar or challenging at first. But it is one of the most powerful gifts we can give our children. When a child knows they are respected, even in their hardest moments, they begin to build a deep, inner sense of worth. They learn that they can struggle and still be loved. That they can make mistakes and still belong. And from that place, true growth begins.\n\nSo in the midst of the chaos, when your child is flailing or your patience is running thin, take a breath. Remember: your child is not giving you a hard time. They’re having a Mhard time. And when we meet them with respect, we teach them something essential—not just about behavior, but about love",

    content: "A parent once told me, “I love everything about Montessori, but I’m not a trained teacher. I’m afraid I’ll get it wrong.” It’s a feeling I’ve heard echoed many times—particularly from thoughtful, caring parents who want to give their children the best start but worry that without a diploma or certification, they aren’t equipped to “do Montessori right.”\n\nHere’s what I want you to hear clearly: You don’t need a Montessori credential to raise your child the Montessori way. You just need to be present, curious, and open to learning alongside them.\n\nFormal training gives classroom guides a foundation in child development, observation, and how to present Montessori materials. But the essence of Montessori isn’t found in credentials—it’s in how we relate to children. It’s in how we speak to them, how we prepare their environments, how we trust in their innate drive to learn. These are things any parent can learn to do, one step at a time.\n\nMontessori isn’t a rigid set of rules—it’s a way of seeing children with respect and wonder. You begin by observing. That means slowing down, watching how your child moves, what they’re drawn to, how they express needs or solve problems. Then you follow their interests, gently supporting them without directing every move. You prepare your home not with elaborate lessons, but by making it more child-friendly—putting their clothes where they can reach, offering child-sized tools for real-life tasks, creating predictable rhythms to their day.\n\nIf you’re still unsure, think about what your child really needs at this stage: a calm adult who sees them, listens to them, and believes in their abilities. Someone who lets them struggle a little to zip their coat or pour their water. Someone who invites them into daily life instead of entertaining them with screens or toys they can’t use independently. That’s Montessori.\n\nMontessori at home can be as simple as involving your child in cooking dinner. Invite your toddler to stand beside you on a sturdy stool and wash vegetables. Let your three-year-old help crack an egg or set the table. These aren’t just practical tasks—they’re moments of connection, of belonging, of real learning. They teach sequencing, coordination, vocabulary, and—perhaps most importantly—confidence.\n\nThe truth is, many parents are already doing Montessori without realizing it. Every time you offer your child a choice, every time you wait a moment longer instead of jumping in, every time you speak respectfully to them and model grace and patience, you are living the principles of Montessori.\n\nWhat you might need most is reassurance, not instruction. You don’t need to be perfect. You don’t need to know everything. Montessori is a process—for children and adults alike. You’ll make mistakes. You’ll get impatient. You’ll forget to observe. And then you’ll try again. That’s growth. That’s the work.\n\nIf you want more guidance, there are books, courses, communities, and resources to support you. But don’t let a lack of formal training hold you back. What matters most is your relationship with your child. When you see them as capable, when you create space for independence, when you hold limits with kindness and lead with love—you’re already doing the work.\n\nYou are qualified. Because you are willing. Because you care. And because your child doesn’t need a perfect Montessori environment. They need a loving parent who believes in their potential. And that parent? That’s you.",

    title: "How Can Homeschooling Parents Support Socialization and Community—Especially When Montessori Emphasizes Mixed-Age Environments?",
    slug: "how-can-homeschooling-parents-support-socialization-and-community-especially-whe",
    content: "It’s one of the most common concerns raised by parents who choose to homeschool, especially those drawn to Montessori: What about socialization? How will my child build friendships, learn to cooperate, and experience the social richness of a classroom—especially one that Montessori designed so intentionally to span multiple years?\n\nIt’s a valid question. Montessori education places great value on mixed-age communities—typically spanning three years—where younger children learn by watching older peers, and older children deepen their understanding through mentoring and leadership. These environments mirror real-life communities, not only in their structure but in their tone: respectful, cooperative, and filled with opportunities for learning through relationship.\n\nIn a Montessori school, this happens organically. The classroom is prepared with a full set of materials and a balance of ages. Children observe, help, collaborate, and work independently—all in the same space. The guides are trained professionals, not family members, and the peer group is wide and diverse. For many parents, this experience is one of the core reasons they choose a Montessori school.\n\nBut what if you’ve chosen Montessori homeschooling—or are considering it—because you want to spend more time with your child, or because school isn’t currently a good fit for your family? How do you support social development in that context?\n\nThe truth is, many Montessori homeschooling families are already finding ways to create community. Parent-led playgroups, homeschooling co-ops, and outdoor nature schools have become increasingly common, especially in urban and suburban areas. These groups often meet once or twice a week, offering children time with peers and parents time with other adults. It’s not the same as a classroom—but it can be a rich supplement.\n\nSome families build socialization into their daily rhythms through structured activities like library storytime, dance or swim classes, nature clubs, or visits to museums and parks. Others connect with like-minded families and intentionally carve out space for shared projects—gardening days, art workshops, even simple neighborhood playdates.\n\nStill, it’s important to be honest about the differences. The level of interaction, collaboration, and social problem-solving that happens naturally in a well-run Montessori classroom is difficult to replicate at home. A true Montessori class is not just a collection of children the same age—it’s a dynamic, carefully balanced microcosm of community. A four-year-old watches a six-year-old write a story and wants to try it too. A five-year-old helps a three-year-old button their coat. These experiences aren’t planned—they emerge from the environment. And they matter.\n\nIn contrast, most homeschool playgroups and co-ops, while valuable, tend to be smaller, less consistent, and more homogeneous in age. There’s less room for children to find their own place in a complex social ecosystem, and fewer natural opportunities to be the youngest or oldest in the group. Social learning still happens—but the range and richness can be narrower.\n\nThat’s not to say it can’t be done. Some homeschooling families build remarkably strong communities—joining forces with other Montessori-inspired parents, creating mixed-age learning pods, or even hiring guides to lead parts of their program. But it requires planning, coordination, and usually a great deal of adult effort.\n\nSo what can parents do in the meantime?\n\nStart small. Invite another family over for a morning of open-ended play or shared activities. Look for opportunities in your local area—Montessori-friendly meetups, homeschool networks, or cooperative learning centers. And most importantly, observe your child. What kind of social experiences do they gravitate toward? What do they need more of?\n\nIf your child is shy or slow to warm up, that’s not a problem to fix—it’s a temperament to honor. Socialization in Montessori is never forced. It’s offered. It grows naturally when children feel safe, trusted, and part of something larger than themselves.\n\nWhether in a homeschool or a classroom, your child’s need for community is real. But so is your ability to support it—one relationship, one invitation, one shared experience at a time.\n\nJust know that choosing to homeschool doesn’t mean giving up on social development. It means reimagining it. And while you may not have a room full of children in a three-year age span, you have something equally powerful: the ability to curate meaningful connections, to model grace and courtesy in daily life, and to build community slowly, thoughtfully, and with deep intention",

    title: "Unlearning First—Preparing Ourselves to Parent the Montessori Way",
    slug: "unlearning-first-preparing-ourselves-to-parent-the-montessori-way",
    content: "One of the most surprising truths about Montessori parenting is this: the biggest shift often isn’t in our children. It’s in us.\n\nMany of us come to Montessori with high hopes and open hearts. We want our children to grow up confident, independent, and kind. We want to give them the kind of childhood we may not have had—one rooted in respect, curiosity, and joyful learning. But even with the best intentions, we sometimes find ourselves reverting to old habits: rushing through routines, overexplaining, correcting too quickly, or trying to control outcomes. We step in when we should step back. We talk when we should listen. We forget to observe.\n\nThis isn’t a sign that we’re failing—it’s a sign that we’re still carrying the habits of our own upbringing and cultural conditioning. Most of us were raised in environments that valued obedience, competition, and speed. We were taught to “be good,” “hurry up,” and “try harder.” Mistakes were something to fix quickly, not to learn from patiently. Feelings were often dismissed rather than acknowledged. That’s what we’re unlearning.\n\nMontessori invites a completely different mindset—one that can feel both inspiring and disorienting at first. Instead of commanding, we guide. Instead of correcting, we model. Instead of entertaining, we prepare an environment where the child can lead. This shift doesn’t happen overnight. It requires reflection, intention, and often, a lot of humility.\n\nConsider a common moment: your child is putting on their shoes. You’re running late. They’re struggling with the straps or putting them on the wrong feet. Every part of you wants to jump in and just do it for them. But Montessori calls us to pause. To ask: What does my child need in this moment? Is it speed—or is it the opportunity to learn, to feel competent, and to be seen trying? When we pause, we begin to unlearn the belief that doing things quickly is always better. We make space for growth.\n\nAnother moment: your child spills a cup of water. Instinctively, you want to scold or swoop in. But what if, instead, you offered a towel and said, “Let’s clean it up together”? In that small shift, you trade shame for skill-building. You help your child learn that mistakes are part of life—and that they can fix them. You’ve unlearned the need for blame and replaced it with respect.\n\nMontessori parenting asks us to observe more than we direct. But observation is a skill we have to practice. It means watching without jumping to conclusions. It means noticing your child’s interests, needs, and rhythms. It means letting go of the impulse to label or compare. You might find yourself thinking, “Why isn’t my child interested in letters like the neighbor’s kid?” But then you notice that your child is deeply engaged in building towers or caring for the dog. And you remember: development isn’t a race. Each child follows their own path. That is the Montessori way.\n\nUnlearning also means changing how we measure progress. In conventional parenting, we might look for grades, milestones, or praise. In Montessori, we look for concentration, repetition, joy in the task. A child who spends twenty minutes carefully transferring beans from one bowl to another is not wasting time—they’re building coordination, patience, and focus. When we slow down, we start to see these moments for what they truly are: signs of growth.\n\nAnd then there’s the hardest part—unlearning the need to be perfect. Montessori doesn’t ask for perfection. It asks for presence. You will lose your temper. You will forget to prepare the environment. You will offer too much help, or not enough. That’s part of the journey. What matters is that you return. That you reflect. That you try again, with greater awareness.\n\nOne mother shared that she used to feel overwhelmed by her toddler’s tantrums—until she began viewing them through the Montessori lens. Instead of trying to stop the meltdown, she learned to sit nearby, breathe, and wait. “Now I say things like, ‘I’m here when you’re ready,’” she said. “It’s changed everything. I don’t feel like I have to fix it. I just have to be there.”\n\nMontessori parenting is as much a path of self-discovery as it is a philosophy of child development. The more we release our need for control, comparison, and quick fixes, the more we open up space for connection. We become more curious. More patient. More attuned.\n\nSo if you’re feeling like you’re getting it wrong, or wondering why it’s so hard to stay calm or let go—take heart. You’re not doing it wrong. You’re doing the work. And in that unlearning, you’re planting the seeds of a new way of being—with your child, and with yourself.",

    title: "What Does ‘Freedom Within Limits’ Actually Mean, and How Does It Promote Peace and Order at Home?",
    slug: "what-does-freedom-within-limits-actually-mean-and-how-does-it-promote-peace-and-",
    content: "“Freedom within limits” is one of those classic Montessori phrases that sounds both appealing and mysterious. It captures the essence of the Montessori approach—but to new parents, it may seem like a contradiction. How can we give freedom and set limits at the same time? And why does this balance matter so much?\n\nLet’s start with what it’s not. Montessori freedom is not the same as permissiveness. It doesn’t mean children get to do whatever they want, whenever they want, without guidance. That kind of “freedom” leads to chaos, frustration, and confusion—for children and adults alike. Children are still growing into their ability to regulate themselves, manage impulses, and make wise choices. They need structure. But they also need room to move, to choose, to act with independence. That’s where the beauty of this approach lives: in the balance.\n\nIn Montessori, freedom is always framed by clear and consistent boundaries. These boundaries—what we call “limits”—create a container of safety and predictability. Within that container, children are free to explore, make choices, and develop independence. This, in turn, creates a sense of peace and order, both within the child and in the home.\n\nImagine your three-year-old has a small shelf of activities in your living room. She is free to choose what she’d like to work with. She can pick the pouring work, or the shape sorter, or the basket of animal figures. But she’s expected to use one at a time, to treat it with care, and to put it away when she’s done. That’s freedom within limits.\n\nOr think about snack time. Instead of telling your child exactly when and what to eat, you might create a simple self-serve snack station: a low shelf with a small pitcher of water, a bowl of cut fruit, and child-sized cups and napkins. Your child can serve herself a snack when she’s hungry—but she’s expected to sit at the table, eat respectfully, and clean up afterward. That’s freedom within limits.\n\nThis structure gives children a profound sense of security. They know what to expect. They understand the rhythm of the day. And because the limits are consistent, they can relax into the freedom that’s available to them. They don’t have to test every boundary to understand where safety lies. It’s already clear.\n\nChildren thrive when they feel capable and respected. And the only way to truly feel capable is to have opportunities to make real choices and take real responsibility. When we constantly correct, direct, or intervene, we rob our children of the chance to learn for themselves. But when we prepare the environment thoughtfully, hold our limits calmly, and step back enough for children to act with agency, we give them the greatest gift of all: the freedom to grow.\n\nThat freedom, by the way, isn’t just for the child—it’s for the whole family. A home built around freedom within limits is a calmer, more peaceful place. It doesn’t depend on micromanagement. It doesn’t swing wildly between control and permissiveness. Instead, it runs on trust, rhythm, and mutual respect. Children are calmer because they know what to expect. Parents are calmer because they don’t feel the need to constantly say no—or yes. The limits are already in place. The choices are already available.\n\nOf course, none of this happens overnight. Like all aspects of Montessori, it’s a process. At first, you might find it hard to let go of control. Or you might find it hard to enforce the limits you’ve set. But over time, with consistency and care, the balance becomes more natural. You’ll begin to notice your child stepping into greater responsibility. You’ll see fewer power struggles. More cooperation. More joy.\n\nFreedom within limits isn’t a trick or a technique—it’s a mindset. It says to the child: I trust you. I believe you are capable. And I will support you by preparing a world that honors your growing independence while keeping you safe, grounded, and connected.\n\nAnd when we hold that balance, we don’t just promote peace and order at home—we model the kind of thoughtful, respectful, and empowered life we hope our children will carry forward into the world.\n\n\n\nBlog Post 12:",

    title: "Guiding, Not Molding—The Heart of Montessori Parenting",
    slug: "guiding-not-molding-the-heart-of-montessori-parenting",
    content: "There’s a common image in parenting: the idea that we shape our children, as though they are raw material waiting to be formed into something useful or beautiful. It’s a metaphor rooted in love, but also in control. And it’s one that Maria Montessori gently but firmly turned on its head.\n\nMontessori saw children not as empty vessels or lumps of clay to be molded, but as whole, complete beings from the very beginning—full of potential, yes, but with a unique inner drive and purpose already within them. Her radical belief, still as urgent today as it was a century ago, is that our job is not to shape, but to guide. To create the conditions where children can unfold according to their true nature—not our agenda.\n\nThis isn’t passive parenting. It doesn’t mean stepping back and letting children run wild. It means learning to see our role with clarity and humility. We are not the sculptors of our children’s lives. We are their guides. Their protectors. Their partners in discovery.\n\nPicture a child walking through a wooded trail. The adult walks just behind—close enough to help if needed, but not leading. Not deciding which rock to climb, which flower to admire, which direction to turn. The child chooses the pace and the path. The adult notices, encourages, and occasionally offers a hand over a slippery root. That’s the essence of Montessori parenting.\n\nIn practical terms, this means we stop asking, “How can I get my child to do what I want?” and start asking, “Who is this child becoming, and how can I support that becoming?”\n\nMaybe your three-year-old is intensely focused on water play. Every day they pour, scrub, splash, and experiment. You had hoped they’d be more interested in puzzles or letter games, but Montessori asks us to trust. That child’s work with water is no less valuable. It’s building fine motor skills, concentration, and a love of process. You don’t need to redirect. You need to prepare the environment—offer pitchers, sponges, cloths, and bowls—and observe what unfolds.\n\nOr perhaps your child is slower to warm up socially. Other parents worry that their child is shy, but you notice that yours watches carefully before joining a group. Instead of pushing them to “speak up” or “make more friends,” you honor their temperament. You offer gentle invitations to social opportunities, but never shame their caution. You trust that their way of connecting is valid. That’s guiding, not molding.\n\nMontessori parenting also means letting go of comparison. Your child may not be reading at four like the neighbor’s daughter. They may still struggle to put on their socks or to share their favorite toy. But if you step back, you’ll often see deep growth: the beginnings of empathy, the persistence in trying, the quiet curiosity taking root. These things don’t always show up on a checklist—but they are the foundation of lifelong learning.\n\nIt takes courage to guide without molding. To resist the urge to “fix” your child when they don’t meet your expectations. To allow them to make mistakes, to be different, to take longer. But this is where the real work of parenting lives—not in shaping outcomes, but in loving presence.\n\nOne mother shared how her daughter, at age four, decided she wanted to wear the same striped dress every day. The mother worried—what would other people think? Should she insist on variety? But then she remembered the heart of Montessori: follow the child. So she washed the dress each evening and let it be. A few weeks later, the phase passed. But the message had landed. Her daughter knew she was trusted to make her own choices. That her voice mattered.\n\nIn a Montessori home, children learn to trust themselves because they are trusted. They don’t become who we want them to be—they become themselves, with confidence and clarity. They carry that into the world not as products of our parenting, but as individuals shaped by their own inner work, lovingly supported.\n\nThis is not always easy. It requires constant observation, reflection, and restraint. But the reward is profound. When we parent as guides, we raise children who are not afraid to think, to feel, to grow. We raise children who belong fully to themselves—and who carry that integrity forward for life.\n\nThat, in the end, is the real heart of Montessori parenting. Not shaping a child into something we imagined, but making space for them to become who they already are.",
